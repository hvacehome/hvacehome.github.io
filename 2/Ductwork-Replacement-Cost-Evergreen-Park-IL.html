<h3>HVAC System in Evergreen Park Illinois</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperatures reach and drop below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which immediately shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the home in these conditions.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your cars and truck. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter as soon as every three months. During high use months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
