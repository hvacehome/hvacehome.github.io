<p>If your single stage air conditioner isn't old sufficient to validate replacement, think about an entire home dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can delight in a few of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, improving indoor air quality and allowing higher convenience at higher temperature levels.<p>
<p>Start by reading the installation handbook and acquainting yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Most systems include a package that includes adjustable window extensions and metal mounting brackets. These parts will guarantee an airtight and secure fit in the window opening. And for additional support, specifically for larger air conditioners, think about buying a steel assistance bracket and install it to the outdoors home wall, straight below the windowsill.<p>
