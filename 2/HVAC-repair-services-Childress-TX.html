<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
