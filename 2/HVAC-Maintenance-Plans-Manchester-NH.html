<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively simple to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants given off by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside might trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases direct exposure to toxins throughout cooking. Incorrect change, frequently indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame idea is blue.

Never utilize a gas stove to heat your house. When the fireplace is in usage, always make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
