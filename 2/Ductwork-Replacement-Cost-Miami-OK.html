<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
