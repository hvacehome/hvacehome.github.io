<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Bentonville AR 72712</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter season can exacerbate issues.
