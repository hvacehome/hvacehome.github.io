<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good location to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's type of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI certification know that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one element (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system likewise may contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly might end up being blocked, lowering air flow distribution, quality, and volume. They also may become locations for molds and bacteria to grow and be distributed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also need to be effectively preserved to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Sometimes a temporary indoor air quality problem is developed just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complicated problems-- determined by regularly unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the three methods below might be appropriate.<p>
