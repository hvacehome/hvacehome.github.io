<p>Details provided in this safety guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. Buildings constantly progress as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them along with the occupants, products, and activities within them. The different surface areas and the air inside a building are continuously interacting, and this interaction results in changes in each. For instance, we may see a window as altering slightly over time as it becomes dirty, then is cleaned up, collects dirt once again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In truth, the dirt" we see might be evolving as a result of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials found there.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
