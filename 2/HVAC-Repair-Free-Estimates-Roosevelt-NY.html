<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>By piping coolant straight into the smaller sized wall-mounted systems, ductless splits permit you to avoid the requirement for a complete duct system like most other cooling systems need. You will likewise delight in a much more flexible system in terms of installation and cost. And because each indoor unit has its own thermostat, you can say goodbye to thermostat warfare when one person would choose it a little warmer in a various room.<p>
