Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
