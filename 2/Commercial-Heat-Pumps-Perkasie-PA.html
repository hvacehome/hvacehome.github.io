<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their total power must not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, since the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not easy, given that it considers not just the small power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
