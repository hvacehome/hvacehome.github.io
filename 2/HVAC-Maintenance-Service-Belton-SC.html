<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion.

<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work till you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
