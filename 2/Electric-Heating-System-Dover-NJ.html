Heating systems that kick on frequently might be due to a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
