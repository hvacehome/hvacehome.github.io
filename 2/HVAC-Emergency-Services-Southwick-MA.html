<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
