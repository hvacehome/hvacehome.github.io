<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Gladstone MI</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
