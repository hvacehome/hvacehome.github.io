Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and extreme moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common kind of home heating-- convection. Over the previous century, the majority of homes in cooler climates were warmed by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the walls, ceilings and floorings heated up. In turn, the things in the room, like furniture and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>

<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
