<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
