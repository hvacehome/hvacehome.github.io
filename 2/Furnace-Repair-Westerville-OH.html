<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
