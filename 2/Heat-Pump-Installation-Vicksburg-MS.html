<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible for the most part, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores. The primary danger of mold growth, as it connects to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More severe than the majority of allergenic properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a major respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Some health effects might show up quickly after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a pollutant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are generally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is merely eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined.

For instance, wind energy can just be utilized when there is wind, while solar energy counts on regular sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and reliable  source of energy.<p>
