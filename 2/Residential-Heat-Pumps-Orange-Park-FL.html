<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Orange Park FL 32073</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>A lot of well and city water does not usually consist of lead. Water normally picks up lead inside the home from home plumbing that is made with lead products.

Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heaters have several control boards. The largest, or only one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t effectively diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
