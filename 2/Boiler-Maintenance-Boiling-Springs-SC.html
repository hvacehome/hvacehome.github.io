<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
