<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options.

We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
