<p>I am a real estate investor, I need to replace 2 heating systems in a 8000square foot house. You can depend on us to get the job done right. We deal with our 4 standard concepts: integrity in everything we do, reliability and punctuality, dealing with everybody with dignity and providing the very best product at an affordable cost, even offering different specials from time to time. Don't enable your heater or furnace to break down when you require it the most. We can make it work as successfully as possible.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
