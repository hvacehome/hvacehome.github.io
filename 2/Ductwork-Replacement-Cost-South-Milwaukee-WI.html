<p>The first ac system and refrigerators used flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>AC Maintenance Near Me in South Milwaukee Wisconsin</h3>
<p>While individuals invest 90% of their time inside, indoor air quality has not been a big focus of attention for facilities management and tenants till just recently.

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it might flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would use.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up simply a couple of years back.<p>

Nevertheless, far too many neighborhoods lack the capacity to truly effect their ecological conditions. This consists of some conditions discovered indoors, along with conditions triggered by outside impacts (such as climate modification).<p>
