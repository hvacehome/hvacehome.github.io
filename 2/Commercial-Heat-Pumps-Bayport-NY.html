<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
