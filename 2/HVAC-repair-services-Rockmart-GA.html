<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Rockmart GA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

In other words, in-floor heater offer a different mode and level of comfort. And, as numerous public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we may be to push down our thermostat, in turn reducing our energy expenditures.<p>
