<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Dingmans Ferry PA</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may see unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.
