<h3>Why You Want Air Conditioning Repair in Chatham VA?</h3>
<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you hire to install your central air system. In fact, you can even DIY, in spite of our strong recommendation not to do so. If you do take our recommendation, anticipate to pay in between $300 and $1,000 in labor expenses to set up central air. Moreover, cooling contractors may charge an additional $50 to $200 for extra supplies and devices.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
