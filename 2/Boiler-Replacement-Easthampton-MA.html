<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
