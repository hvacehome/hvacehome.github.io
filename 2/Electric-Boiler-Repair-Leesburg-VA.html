After 2 years, things started to alter. There have actually been uncomfortable sounds. I got it repaired and inspected. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. In general, it has actually been a great experience. Reliable on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its appearances in the beginning. But then recognized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven.
