<p>Forced air systems are the most typical heating system types on the market, however they're not constantly the best option for every single home.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
<p>The most common kind of house heating unit in the U.S. burns natural gas or gas to produce heat.
