<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
