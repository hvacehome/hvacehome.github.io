<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home building and construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floorings.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>
