<p>Air conditioners can develop a lot of water because they get rid of moisture from the air. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In truth, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
