(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was very extensive and on-time in discussing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn provided great customer support at the end of the consultation by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few recommendations of some maintenance jobs we might want to have actually carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques utilized by some in the market.<p>
