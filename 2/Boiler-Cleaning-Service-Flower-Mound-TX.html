<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions should also be required to minimize pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, residents should be alert to the development of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization steps ought to not be carried out up until these issues have been corrected.<p>
<p>We take a look at clues prior to we supply advice to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater every year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as crucial when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
