<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
