<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely practical in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.
