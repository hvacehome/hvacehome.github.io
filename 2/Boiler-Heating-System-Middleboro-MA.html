What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
