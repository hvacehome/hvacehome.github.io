<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that gathers throughout summertimes. The best thing to do is making certain that the heater burners are inspected and cleaned up completely before colder seasons start.

If your furnace is in a very bad condition, perhaps it is time to begin considering purchasing a brand-new one.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air conditioning unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy effective than models made 5 years ago, so it makes financial sense to change or update your unit if it's five years of ages or older. The best central air conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while delivering the same quantity of cooling.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
