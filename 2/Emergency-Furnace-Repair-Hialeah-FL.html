<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should look out for. First, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
