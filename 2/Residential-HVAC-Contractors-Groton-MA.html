<p>You might update to the highest efficiency equipment readily available and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system. The average home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining how much air escapes the system.<p>
