<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
