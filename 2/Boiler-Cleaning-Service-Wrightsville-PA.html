<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
