<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to test the ac system prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We want we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
