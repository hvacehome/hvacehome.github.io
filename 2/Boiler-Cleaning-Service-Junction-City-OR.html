<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
