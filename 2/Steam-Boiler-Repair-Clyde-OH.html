<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
