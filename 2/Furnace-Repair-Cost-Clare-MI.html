<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
