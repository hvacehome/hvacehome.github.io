Due to the fact that they only partially get rid of the radon decay products and do not reduce the amount of radon getting in the home, the effectiveness of these devices is unpredictable.

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies more details on air-cleaning gadgets to decrease indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years earlier and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
