<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Avondale AZ</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent.

He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
