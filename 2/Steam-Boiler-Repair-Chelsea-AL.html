<h3>Assessing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System at Chelsea AL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
