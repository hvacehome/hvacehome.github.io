<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Calhoun GA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field.

From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
