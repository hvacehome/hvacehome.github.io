HVAC specialists recommend following this basic rule when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the rate of a new system, it's best to buy new.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>There are a couple of possibilities to explain short cycling in very cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the very low temperatures. Often, the furnace will simply run harder to preserve a warm climate for your home when the weather is incredibly cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. Contact among our service technicians if you require clearness on this issue.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Air, ventilation and heating Conditioning, and refers to the environment control systems set up in houses or commercial residential or commercial properties.
