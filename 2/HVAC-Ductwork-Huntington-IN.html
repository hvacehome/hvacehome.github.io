<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually just offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a good way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system.
