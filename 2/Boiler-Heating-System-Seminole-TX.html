<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and place of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

<p>Our indoor air quality professionals can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To reduce pollutants, we recommend setting up advanced air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are developed to get rid of the tiniest particles from the air.

A lot of store-bought filters can not remove these smallest of allergens and do not remove bacteria and gases.<p>

A more energy efficient house will not only minimize the cost of a new system and energy bills, however it will considerably improve the convenience of your house. Before we design and install any systems, we set up a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these enhancements. Standard enhancements typically consist of adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can recommend several competent home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for referrals.<p>

<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and final floor finish. This is usually used in a second or third-floor  area and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your investment by just utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a certified representative from an organisation or seller to do the installation. If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed person to do the work, in a lot of, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the a/c system. A voided service warranty will not do you any good must the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the outset and hire a certified individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
