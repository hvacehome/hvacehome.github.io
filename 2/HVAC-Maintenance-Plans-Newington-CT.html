<h3>Why You Need Air Conditioning Repair in Newington CT?</h3>
<p>Whether it's the middle of winter season or summer, having a working HVAC system is important. At Lowe's, we have a variety of heating and cooling systems-- from furnaces and heat pumps to window air conditioning unit and portable air conditioners Plus, we provide air conditioning installation and heating installation by licensed professional independent installers.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
