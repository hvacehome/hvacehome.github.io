Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building materials, cigarette smoking, household items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in produced items. For example, it is utilized to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finishing items.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room.

Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy.
