<p>A geothermal heatpump is among the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a house. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be warmed in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found just a few feet below ground.
