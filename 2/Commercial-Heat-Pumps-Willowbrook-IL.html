<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 ought to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
