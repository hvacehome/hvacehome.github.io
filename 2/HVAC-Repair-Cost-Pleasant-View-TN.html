<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Often times, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, because the system is combined.
