<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
