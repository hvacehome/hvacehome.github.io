<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for. They satisfied my requirements totally by providing an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also immediately followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, flooring, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold growth and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy odor however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in covert or rarely accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, possibilities exist will be mold growing nearby. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
