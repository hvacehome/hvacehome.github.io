<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent however Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is honest, trustworthy, and affordable on price. It's tough to find a truthful AC man and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
