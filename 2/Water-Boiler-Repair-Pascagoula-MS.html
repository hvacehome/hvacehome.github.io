<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
