We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to check the ac system prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We want we had actually known him then.<p>

<p>The bureau projects 34 percent employment development for HVAC service technicians between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all professions.

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
