But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
