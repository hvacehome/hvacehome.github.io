<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil.
