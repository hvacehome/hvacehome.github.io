<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the greater temperatures sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
