Local building codes likely specify the quantity (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that should be constantly provided in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA).

It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>

Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
