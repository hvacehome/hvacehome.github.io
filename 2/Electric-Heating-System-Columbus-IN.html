<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Columbus IN?</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math lately, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
