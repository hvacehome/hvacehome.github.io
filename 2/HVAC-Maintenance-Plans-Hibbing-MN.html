<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
