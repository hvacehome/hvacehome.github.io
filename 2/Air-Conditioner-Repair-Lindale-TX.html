<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
