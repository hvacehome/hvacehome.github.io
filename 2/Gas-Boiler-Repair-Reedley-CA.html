<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They advised changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part.

<h3>Picking the Ideal HVAC System For The Project in Reedley CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
