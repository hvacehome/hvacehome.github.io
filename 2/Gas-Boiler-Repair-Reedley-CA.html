They weren't cheap however a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working.

<h3>Picking the Ideal HVAC System For The Project in Reedley CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
