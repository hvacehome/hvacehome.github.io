<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Because they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions.
