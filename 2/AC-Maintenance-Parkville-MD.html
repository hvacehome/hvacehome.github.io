<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Parkville MD</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes installed under the flooring or right within the flooring surface area itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not count on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
