In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner increase.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%.
