<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible.
