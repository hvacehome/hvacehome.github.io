<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other specialists interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building materials, smoking cigarettes, family items, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in manufactured products. For example, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and draperies, as a part of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finishing items.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters homes through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. Exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes caught in concentrations and structures construct up indoors.<p>
