<p>When setting up over concrete pieces, we advise utilizing our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by serving as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to provide threshold signals. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might set up your tracking devices to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to deal with the circumstance instantly.<p>
