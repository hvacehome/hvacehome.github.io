<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can manage, many Seattleites must find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a terrible, cruel summer season.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that frequently, our nationally representative study found.

And practically 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
