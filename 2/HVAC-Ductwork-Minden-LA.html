Also they identified the problem and fixed extremely quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>

The circuit boards coordinate the operation and manage of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
