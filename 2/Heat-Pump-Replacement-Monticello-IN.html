<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Before you go out and buy an a/c, there are a couple of things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning system? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How large should the a/c unit be? Too big and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning system and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioner won't be able to cool your home appropriately. These are just a few of the elements that you need to take into account when shopping for a new AC system. Each option can and will considerably impact your system's performance, which is why you can't manage to ignore any of them.<p>
