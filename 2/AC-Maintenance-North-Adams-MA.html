<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up.

This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
