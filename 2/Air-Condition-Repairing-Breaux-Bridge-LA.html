<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
