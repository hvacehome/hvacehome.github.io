Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leakages, merely including refrigerant is not a service. A skilled technician needs to fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant.

They include hold-ups in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, fetuses, and children are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups since lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead.

The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight.
