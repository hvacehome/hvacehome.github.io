<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All of us face a variety of threats to our health as we go about our everyday lives. Driving in cars, flying in aircrafts, taking part in recreational activities, and being exposed to toxic wastes all pose differing degrees of threat. Some dangers are just unavoidable. Some we pick to accept due to the fact that to do otherwise would restrict our capability to lead our lives the way we desire. And some are dangers we might decide to prevent if we had the chance to make educated choices. Indoor air contamination is one risk that you can do something about.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
