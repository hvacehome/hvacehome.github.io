But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly seem greater than regular, it is probably time to consider a brand-new system.

<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily incorporated with existing systems such as conventional forced air or glowing floor heating or can be set up in a new structure. Forced air systems will require a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heating systems will need water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop required depends on the heating and cooling requirements for your home and is important iin guaranteeing the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is determined in tons. Typically, a 3-ton setup needs to be adequate for the average home, however house size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land availability are all aspects which will influence the proper size for your specific home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you correctly size a system.<p>
