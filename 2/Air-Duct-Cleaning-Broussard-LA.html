<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
