<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
