<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at West Plains MO</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
