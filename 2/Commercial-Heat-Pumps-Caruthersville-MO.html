<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent informing me about our system, and left having resolved the issue with a basic repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part.

<h3>Ventilation Systems in Caruthersville Missouri</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
