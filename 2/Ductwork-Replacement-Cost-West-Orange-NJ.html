However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel costs suddenly seem higher than normal, it is most likely time to consider a new system.

<p>The first air conditioning unit and refrigerators employed harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was sort of weird being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.
