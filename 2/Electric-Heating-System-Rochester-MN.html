For example, he may seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed just a few years ago.<p>
