<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage.

Heaters that kick on often may be because of a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
