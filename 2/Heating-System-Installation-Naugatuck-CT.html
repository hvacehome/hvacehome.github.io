<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and connected them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping machine to distribute hot water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the harmony of the flooring heat moved heat to other short articles in the rooms, consisting of the human occupants.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>
