<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews in Rawlins WY</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and trouble in breathing in some humans exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations may trigger attacks in individuals with asthma. There is evidence that some people can develop a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has also been revealed to trigger cancer in animals and may cause cancer in human beings.<p>

<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically triggered by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of impurities from sources in the house.
