<p>Though it might be difficult to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your house, but there are numerous other pollutants that can not just unclean up the air, however result in other health problems.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
