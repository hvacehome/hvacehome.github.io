<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators used harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
