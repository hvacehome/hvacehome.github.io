<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if essential, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he might seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more efficient solution to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
