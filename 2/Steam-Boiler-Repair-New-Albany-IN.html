<p>There are many actions a homeowner can require to select items that will prevent indoor air problems from taking place - a number of them are mentioned here. First, use exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider utilizing strong wood products. Second of all, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make certain that a reliable wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet.

<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
