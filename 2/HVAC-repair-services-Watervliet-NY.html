<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
