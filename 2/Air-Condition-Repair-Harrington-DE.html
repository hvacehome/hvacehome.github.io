<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in collecting info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
