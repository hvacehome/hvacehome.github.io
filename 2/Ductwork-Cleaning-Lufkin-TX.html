<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. Once the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly solidify and treat-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
