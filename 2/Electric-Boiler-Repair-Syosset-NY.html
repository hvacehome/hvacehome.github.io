This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
