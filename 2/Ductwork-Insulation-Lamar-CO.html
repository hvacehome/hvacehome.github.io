<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your Lamar CO Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
