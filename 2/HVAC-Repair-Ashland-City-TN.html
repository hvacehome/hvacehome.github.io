<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled.
