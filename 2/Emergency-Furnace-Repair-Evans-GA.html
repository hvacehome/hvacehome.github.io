<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
