<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, most Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC system is not working.

Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
