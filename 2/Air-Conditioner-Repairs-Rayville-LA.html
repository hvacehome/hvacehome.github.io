<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Rayville LA</h3>
<p>Each repair we carry out is very important to us. Our AC service technicians are professionally trained, and they continue to pursue ongoing education. You'll discover them educated about your specific AC system. The issue will be diagnosed correctly and the repair performed effectively.

You'll have the chance to evaluate and approve a cost quote before we begin.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
