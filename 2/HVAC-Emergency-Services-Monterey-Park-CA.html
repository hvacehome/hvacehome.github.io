<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as an Important Company in Los Angeles. Changed to utilizing Wachoff's about a year back and they have actually been to the house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced reasonably, have actually managed the one repair I needed well, and are always on-time and professional. Have been through a couple of companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is certainly the best I have actually had the opportunity to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been terrific.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
