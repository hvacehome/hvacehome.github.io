From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some standard maintenance.

<p>Asthmatic children are especially at danger.

<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
