<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants.
