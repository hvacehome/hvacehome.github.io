<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms.
