<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating devices can last for several years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel expenses unexpectedly seem higher than typical, it is probably time to consider a brand-new system. New heating devices is much more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel bills immediately, not to point out the cash you'll save money on repair expenses.

<p>I'll start with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating unit in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
