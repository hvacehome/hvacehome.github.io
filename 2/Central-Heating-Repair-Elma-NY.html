<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might discover moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
