<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the unit has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
