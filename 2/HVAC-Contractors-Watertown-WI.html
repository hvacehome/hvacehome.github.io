<p>All heater have some level of air purification. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some basic maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot beside the radiators.
