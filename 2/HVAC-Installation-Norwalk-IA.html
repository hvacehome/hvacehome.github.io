Similar data is not readily available for long-term, low-level exposures to a combination of impurities as is the case for IAQ issues.

<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Airborne irritants are merely a reality of life. Molds can cause flare-ups of allergy signs, and in many cases, trigger asthma attacks. Germs, bacteria, and infections likewise can reside in the air you breathe every day. These airborne toxins can impact your home comfort devices, too. Enabled to flow through your home and your system, these and other particles can build up on the indoor coil, preventing air flow and decreasing heating and cooling performance. By using the product or services we offer, you can minimize and often get rid of these unwanted air-borne toxins from your home, leaving tidy air and safe surface areas throughout your household.<p>
