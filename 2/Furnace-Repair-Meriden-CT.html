<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, because the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor system. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not simple, because it takes into consideration not just the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven.

Follow the guidelines above under A/c Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
