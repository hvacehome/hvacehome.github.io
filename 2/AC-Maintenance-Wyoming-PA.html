<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
