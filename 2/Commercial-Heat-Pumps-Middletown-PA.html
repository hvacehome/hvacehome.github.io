<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioning system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Simply including refrigerant is not a solution if it leaks. A skilled technician needs to repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the efficiency and efficiency of your a/c unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>
