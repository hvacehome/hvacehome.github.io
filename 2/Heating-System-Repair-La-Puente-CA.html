<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in La Puente CA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in house building is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in floors, roofing systems, and walls.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that hinders the shipment of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can cause unconsciousness and death.
