<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit increase. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
