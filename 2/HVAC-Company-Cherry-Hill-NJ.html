Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
