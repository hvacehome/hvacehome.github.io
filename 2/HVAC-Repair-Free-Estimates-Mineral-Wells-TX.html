<p>Sean was very useful. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor.
