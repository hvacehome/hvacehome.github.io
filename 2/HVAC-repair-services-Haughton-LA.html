<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
