<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is an extremely pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
