<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. Throughout high usage months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>Both need to be kept clean due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
