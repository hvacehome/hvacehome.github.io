<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
