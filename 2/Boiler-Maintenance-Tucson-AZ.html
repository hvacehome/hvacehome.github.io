<p>Particular instant results resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often challenging to figure out if the signs are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is essential to take note of the time and location signs happen. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is away from the area, for example, an effort needs to be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes.
