An example of time control is setting up flooring stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This allows items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Location control involves moving the contaminant source far from residents or even relocating prone occupants.<p>
<p>Individuals who dislike these pollutants should utilize allergen-proof bed mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and avoid room furnishings that accumulate dust, particularly if they can not be cleaned in hot water.
