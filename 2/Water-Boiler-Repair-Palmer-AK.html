<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Vital Company in Los Angeles.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will absolutely be utilizing them again.<p>
