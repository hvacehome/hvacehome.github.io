<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Collegeville PA</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math recently, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler normally occur when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. In most cases, the belt is incorrectly lined up or worn and requires replacement. Follow the directions above under Air conditioning system Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
