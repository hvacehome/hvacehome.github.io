<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the greater temperature levels often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to offer thermal convenience inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors.
