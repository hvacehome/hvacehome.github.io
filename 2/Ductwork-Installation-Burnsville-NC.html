<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a possibility to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
