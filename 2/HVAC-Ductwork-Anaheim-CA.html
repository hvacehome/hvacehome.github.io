<p>A specialized ac system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the very same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, since all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated, simply as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>
