He dedicated to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of sensible ones got.

ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up inspection results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 unit it changed (also Provider).<p>
