<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Coos Bay OR</h3>
<p>Pricing for furnace service and maintenance will vary commonly from dealership to dealer, for a number of factors. Some dealerships will be provide a more thorough service with stated efficiency assurances, while others might do a more fundamental service at a special rate to create brand-new company.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
