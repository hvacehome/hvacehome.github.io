<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter as soon as every three months. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
