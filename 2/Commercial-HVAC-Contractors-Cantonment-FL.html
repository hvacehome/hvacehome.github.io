The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
