Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon.

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
