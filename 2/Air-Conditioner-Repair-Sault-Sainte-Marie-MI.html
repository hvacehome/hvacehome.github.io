<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
