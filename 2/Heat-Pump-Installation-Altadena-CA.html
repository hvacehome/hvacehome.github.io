Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy.
