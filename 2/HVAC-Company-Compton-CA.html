<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent.

He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
