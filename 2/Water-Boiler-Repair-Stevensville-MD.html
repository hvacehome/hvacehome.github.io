<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
