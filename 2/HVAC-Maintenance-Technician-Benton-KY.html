Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
