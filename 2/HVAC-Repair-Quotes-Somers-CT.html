<p>You ought to always hire an expert to carry out AC repair, for the same reason that you trust a professional plumbing technician or electrical contractor.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
