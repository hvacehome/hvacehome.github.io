<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>I have had the satisfaction of dealing with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for nearly ten years and throughout that time, they have always provided excellent service.

If it blows once again, call a pro-- you have actually got more severe problems.<p>
