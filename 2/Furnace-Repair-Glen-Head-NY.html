Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>

Area control involves moving the pollutant source far from occupants or perhaps moving prone occupants.<p>
