<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
