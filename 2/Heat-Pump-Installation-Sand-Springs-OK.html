<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Sand Springs OK</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really happy that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to check the a/c prior to you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to check AC units even in winter. We want we had understood him then.<p>
<p>First, understand that a bulk of your central air and unit cost will come from the system itself. AC unit costs start at $2,000 and can actually exceed $10,000 for larger homes. As you saw just recently, you need an appropriately-sized system for your house. Otherwise, the AC will break down quicker than expected or your regular monthly energy costs will skyrocket. Therefore, you do not have overall control as to your AC system material expenses.<p>
