<p>Before you head out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning unit?

Too big and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioning system and reduce its life. Too small and your a/c won't have the ability to cool your home correctly.

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities.

The good news is that the one significant drawback of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to change the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system.

However, considering current changes in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it may be better to replace the whole system.<p>
