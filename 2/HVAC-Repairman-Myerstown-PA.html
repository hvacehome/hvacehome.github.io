After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
