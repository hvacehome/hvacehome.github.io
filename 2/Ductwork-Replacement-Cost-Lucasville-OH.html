Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
