<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a portion performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
