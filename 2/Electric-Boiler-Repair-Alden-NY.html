<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to run since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a possibility to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
