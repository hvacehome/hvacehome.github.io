For instance, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
