<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Frankfort Kentucky</h3>
<p>The Texas Departement of State Health Services (DSHS) Indoor Air Quality Branch has established a listing of certified indoor air specialists in Texas The list represents people holding a professional certification relating to indoor air quality from various organizations. Please note that DSHS does NOT accredit or accredit these individuals as indoor air specialists. Consumers must be wary of any company or individual declaring to be licensed or licensed by DSHS in this specific field. (DSHS does, however, license people involved in lead-related activities and asbestos-related activities ).<p>
<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your company should examine measurements of temperature, humidity and air flow. In addition, evaluation and testing of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to ensure it is working according to specifications for constructing use and tenancy) should be performed. A building walk-through to check for odors and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or insect droppings may be practical. Leaks need to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning systems, on roofings and in boiler pans can become contaminated with fungis or bacteria and need to be removed, also. In some circumstances, particular screening for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of building occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Have you been sweltering in your car recently? Maybe your car's a/c isn't operating properly. At Eric's Garage we have qualified service specialists who can fix your a/c.
