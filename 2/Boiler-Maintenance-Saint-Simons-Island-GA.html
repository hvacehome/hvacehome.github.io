<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. Another element of the job is encouraging clients as to how to prevent future problems and correctly maintain devices by, for example, routinely oiling parts or altering filters.

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have two significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
