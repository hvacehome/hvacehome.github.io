<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold might be living in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. However a lot of the important things people do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of airborne pollutants in their houses and intensify asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>

After that, you can make a better ideal decision on how frequently your HVAC filters require replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one cooling filter need replacing more often.<p>
