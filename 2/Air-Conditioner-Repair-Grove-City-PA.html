Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end goal.
