<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
