<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same pollutants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
