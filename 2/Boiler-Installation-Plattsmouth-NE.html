<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has been used typically in a range of structure construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have actually banned several asbestos products. Producers have also voluntarily limited usages of asbestos. Today, asbestos is most frequently found in older houses, in pipe and furnace insulation products, asbestos shingles, millboard, textured paints and other coating products, and floor tiles.<p>
<p>To be honest, few of the facilities supervisors who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service concerned us because of that. Most of the time they were initially thinking about from another location keeping an eye on some other element of their structures, such as energy use, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't till later, as they continued dealing with us, that they discovered and executed indoor air quality monitoring to provide a healthier, more secure building environment-- and to avoid the negative effects related to indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
