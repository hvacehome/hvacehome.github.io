And, if you've registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
