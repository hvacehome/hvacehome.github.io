<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

He likewise reacted to my call instantly the next early morning, and coached me through a short-lived fix to an issue that couldn't be solved on the first visit due to unavailable parts. I rely on Nick's skills, experience and ability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
