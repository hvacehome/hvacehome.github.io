An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged.

If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>

<p>I have had the satisfaction of dealing with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for nearly ten years and throughout that time, they have constantly offered exemplary service. Everyone I have dealt with is friendly and professional. The techs are timely, efficient and polite.

<p>Prior to setting up any brand-new heating or cooling system in a home, it is necessary to re decrease the energy and assess load of the home. A more energy efficient home will not only reduce the cost of a new system and energy bills, however it will considerably enhance the comfort of your house. Before we design and set up any systems, we set up a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these enhancements. Fundamental enhancements typically consist of adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can suggest numerous certified house Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
