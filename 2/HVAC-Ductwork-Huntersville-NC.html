My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
