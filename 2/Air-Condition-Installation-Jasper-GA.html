<p>Specialist heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
