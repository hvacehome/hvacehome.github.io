<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
