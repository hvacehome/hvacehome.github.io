<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for performance.

If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite costly if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
