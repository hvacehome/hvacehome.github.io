<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They consist of delays in psychological and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, babies, and kids are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults since lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the harmful results of lead. Kids may have higher exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
