<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Michigan City IN 46360</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
