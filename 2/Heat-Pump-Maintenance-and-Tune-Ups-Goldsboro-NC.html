<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and effectiveness if you currently have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to search for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
