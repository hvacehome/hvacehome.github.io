<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Hillsboro MO</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  unit rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater since the technicians thought they just didn't appear right and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
