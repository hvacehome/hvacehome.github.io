<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
