The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
