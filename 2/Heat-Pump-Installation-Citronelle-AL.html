<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>As kept in mind, inappropriate temperature level and humidity levels, and too little or excessive air circulation may also add to employee health grievances. Temperature levels must vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air circulation must be prevented. Maintenance of appropriate temperatures and humidity levels and proper air flow will help to minimize the incident of upper respiratory signs, and, potentially, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a variety of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has actually determined structure products, home furnishings, and mold as severe issues, but much of the risk also comes from burning things. For instance, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop pollution in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially big problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
