<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, because it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
