<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Benton Harbor MI HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Aspects that can add to the development of biological pollutants are wet or moist structure materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungis and germs grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
