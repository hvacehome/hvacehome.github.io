<h3>Which Exactly Are Inverted Heat Pumps in West Milford NJ?</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>

No additional charge.<p>

<p>I have been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is honest, dependable, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
