<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Phoenix AZ</h3>
<p>Sometimes, heating repairs are simply not possible. Perhaps your furnace is too old, your heatpump is too damaged, or your boiler just can't be fixed. Whatever the case, certain circumstances call for full-scale heating replacement. At Horizon Services, we have been helping house owners throughout Delaware, Southern New Jersey, Southeastern Pennsylvania, and Northeastern Maryland replace their homes' heating systems when their old ones are no longer practical.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
