<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He assisted me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is sincere, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
