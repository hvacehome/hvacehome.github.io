<p>Particular immediate results are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often hard to identify if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is important to take note of the time and location the symptoms take place. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is far from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is poorly eliminated from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.

This means that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
