<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is honest, trusted, and sensible on rate. It's hard to find a truthful AC guy and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is likewise a choice for property owners to consider. Many times, these units include not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity.
