<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
