<p>A health questionnaire need to be developed and dispersed to all worried workers. Such a tool needs to recognize the variety of individuals impacted; define ages and job descriptions of involved workers; figure out where they are located within the office; suggest when the symptoms occur (time of day, day of week, and season); supply a list of specific health symptoms or health problems; recognize all makers run in the office; show the kind of outside air pollution; and identify prospective sources of job stress.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however many use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better service. If the current system has not incurred other significant repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and problems that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and corrected, repairing the system can make a lot of sense also.<p>
