Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits.

<p>Oil heaters tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly.
