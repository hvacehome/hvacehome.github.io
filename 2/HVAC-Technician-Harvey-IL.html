<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
