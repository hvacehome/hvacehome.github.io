<h3>Repair and Care for Ocean City MD Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>The majority of people know that outside air contamination can impact their health, but indoor air contamination can also have considerable, damaging effect. EPA research studies of human exposure to air contaminants suggest that indoor levels of pollutants might be 2 to five times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination among the top 5 ecological health dangers to the general public.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
