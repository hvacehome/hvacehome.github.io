<p>When attempting to figure out how frequently I need to change my air conditioning filters, there are lots of things to take into consideration.

After that, you can make a much better ideal decision on how often your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll have to clean them.

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
