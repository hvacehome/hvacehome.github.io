<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
