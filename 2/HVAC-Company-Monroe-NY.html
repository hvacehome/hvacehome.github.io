<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up.
