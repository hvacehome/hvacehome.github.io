<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for several years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly appear greater than typical, it is probably time to consider a new system.

<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most typical heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for performance. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>
