<p>The primary reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services offered. The cost might not be rewarding if the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's service warranty. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the maker's service warranty. However, some producers require routine maintenance as a regard to the warranty.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who explained our alternatives did an outstanding job in making certain we comprehended the benefits and drawbacks of each option. The technicians who installed the brand-new system were expert and fast, while requiring time to ensure we understood how the brand-new system worked. In general a first rate experience.<p>
