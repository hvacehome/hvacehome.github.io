<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them till they have actually been effectively dried. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
