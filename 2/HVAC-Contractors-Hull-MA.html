<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

Forced air heater also tend to create cold and hot spots throughout your house, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a room and sinks as it cools.<p>

Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a offered and reputable  source of energy.<p>
