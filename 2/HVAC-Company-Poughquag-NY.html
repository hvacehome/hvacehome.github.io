<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Numerous typical building products used prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Usually, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Since the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the elimination process, removal of asbestos-containing products is not constantly optimal. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
