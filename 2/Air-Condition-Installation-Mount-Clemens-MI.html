Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

I would extremely recommend him for all your HVAC needs.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working, integrity Energy was fast to respond. They appeared the next day and changed two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new heating systems can heat your home. Truthfully, our home heater is complicated, Rob and his group fixed the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
<p>This review is for replacing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat.
