<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
