The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 must be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
