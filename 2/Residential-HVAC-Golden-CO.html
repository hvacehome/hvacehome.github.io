<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
