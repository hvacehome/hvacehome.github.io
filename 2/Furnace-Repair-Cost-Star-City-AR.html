<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
