<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
