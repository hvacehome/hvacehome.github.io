<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
