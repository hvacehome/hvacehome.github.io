<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
