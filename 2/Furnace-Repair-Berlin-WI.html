<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be quickly incorporated with existing systems such as conventional forced air or glowing floor heating or can be installed in a new structure.

Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in tons. Normally, a 3-ton setup needs to be adequate for the average home, however home size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land availability are all factors which will influence the correct size for your particular house. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can assist you effectively size a system.<p>
