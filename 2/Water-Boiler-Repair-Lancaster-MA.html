<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Wants in Lancaster MA</h3>
<p>After residing in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the air conditioning. I went on and purchased this Carrier and I must say it gets the job done quite well. It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool down the house which is among the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the concern and fixed really quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but lots of use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a better solution.
