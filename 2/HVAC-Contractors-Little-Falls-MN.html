Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
