<p>Oftentimes, if materials have failed to dry out several days after the believed water event, mold growth is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not immediately noticeable.

<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Stevensville MT 59870</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
