<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " top environmental hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are many ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Before it was known how hazardous lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>Through normal usage and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning unit might end up being really dirty.
