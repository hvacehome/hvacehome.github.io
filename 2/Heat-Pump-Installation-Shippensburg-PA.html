Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
