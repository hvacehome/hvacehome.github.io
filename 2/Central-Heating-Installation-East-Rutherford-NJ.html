<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
