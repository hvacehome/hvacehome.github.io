<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it. Any airflow constraint will reduce the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, since it is protected indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
