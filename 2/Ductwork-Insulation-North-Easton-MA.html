<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
