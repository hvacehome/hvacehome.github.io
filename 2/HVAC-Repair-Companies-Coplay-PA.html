<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
