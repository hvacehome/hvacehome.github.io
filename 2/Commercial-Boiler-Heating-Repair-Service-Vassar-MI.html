There are numerous style techniques in use today; nevertheless, all ground source heat pumps run with similar concepts. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth.

<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We selected getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
