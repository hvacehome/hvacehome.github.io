<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
