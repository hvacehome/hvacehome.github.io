<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a referral in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
