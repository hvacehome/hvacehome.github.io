<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.)

For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
