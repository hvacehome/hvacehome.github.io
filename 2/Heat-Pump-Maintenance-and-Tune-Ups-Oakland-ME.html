<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
