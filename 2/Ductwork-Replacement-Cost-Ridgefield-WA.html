Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors get rid of contaminants directly from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly lowers exposure to contaminants throughout cooking. Improper adjustment, frequently suggested by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame idea is blue. Think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously if you purchase a new gas stove or range. Never use a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in usage, constantly make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
