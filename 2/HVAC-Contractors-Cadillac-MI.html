<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, considering that some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
