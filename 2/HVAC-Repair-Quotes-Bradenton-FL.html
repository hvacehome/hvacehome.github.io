<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
