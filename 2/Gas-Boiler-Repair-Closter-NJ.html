Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
