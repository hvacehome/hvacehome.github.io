Based on the typical temperature levels in our location, if you compared running your furnace to a vehicle it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life-span of 15 years.

<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to offer threshold alerts. If, for example, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your tracking equipment to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the proper action to resolve the circumstance instantly.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
