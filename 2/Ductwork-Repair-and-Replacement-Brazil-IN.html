<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
