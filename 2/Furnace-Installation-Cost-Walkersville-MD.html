High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures build up inside your home, exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
