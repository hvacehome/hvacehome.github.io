Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Professionals advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and typically are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is frequently essential to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this information might identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping track of data may not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
