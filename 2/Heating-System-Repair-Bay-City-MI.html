<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Bay City MI</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of sensible ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install inspection results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
