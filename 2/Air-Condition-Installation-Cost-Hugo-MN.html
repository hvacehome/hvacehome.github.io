<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
