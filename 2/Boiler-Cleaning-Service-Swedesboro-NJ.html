<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are handled in a way that produces dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these products present a risk only.

This can result in the capacity for considerable health problems.<p>
