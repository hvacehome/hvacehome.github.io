<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Problems in East Berlin PA</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions require.

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
