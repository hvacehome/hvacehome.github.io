<p>Make certain there are no rugs, furniture, or anything else restricting the flow of air. Not only will obstructed vents and signs up impact your convenience, they can likewise cause duct leakages due to extreme atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and signs up in unused rooms is NOT a good idea. You won't save any additional money and will end up triggering more issues for your heater.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur in time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
