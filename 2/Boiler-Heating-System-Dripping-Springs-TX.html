<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the exact same in all other locations.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
