<p>. Before selecting the installation location of ac system, a number of main elements require to be thought about. First off, the instructions of air circulation from the indoor units need to not fall on the place of rest or work area. Second of all, there must not be any barriers on the way of the air flow that might prevent it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
