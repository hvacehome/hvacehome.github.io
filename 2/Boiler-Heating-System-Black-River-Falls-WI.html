<p>The rest of the HVAC system likewise requires to be in top condition for the a/c to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the house.

The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
