<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
