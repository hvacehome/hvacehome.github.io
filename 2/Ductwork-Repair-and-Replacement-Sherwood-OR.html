<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heatpump work effectively in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
