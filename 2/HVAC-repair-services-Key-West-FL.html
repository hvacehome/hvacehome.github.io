<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Open windows or utilize exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common method of minimizing exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will lower but not get rid of exposure to ecological tobacco smoke. Since smoking produces such big quantities of toxins, mechanical or natural ventilation techniques do not remove them from the air in your house as rapidly as they develop. In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it requires to significantly reduce exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can likewise increase energy costs considerably. Consequently, the most efficient method to reduce direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the house is to remove smoking cigarettes there.<p>
