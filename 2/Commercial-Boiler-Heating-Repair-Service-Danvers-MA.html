Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
