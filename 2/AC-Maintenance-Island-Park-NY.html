What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
