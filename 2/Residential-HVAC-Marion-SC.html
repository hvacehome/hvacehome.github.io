<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
