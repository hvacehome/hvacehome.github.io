The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a referral later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
