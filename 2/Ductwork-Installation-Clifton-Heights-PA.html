<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
