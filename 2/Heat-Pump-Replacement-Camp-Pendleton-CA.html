But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

Am happy I got this though since it has actually restored my faith in excellent production. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this new Provider I got given that I bought it 7 months ago. Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>
