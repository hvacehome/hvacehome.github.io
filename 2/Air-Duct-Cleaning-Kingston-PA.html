<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>At Bob's Heating & Cooling, we take terrific pride in using basic, stylish solutions to the full spectrum of HVAC requires.
