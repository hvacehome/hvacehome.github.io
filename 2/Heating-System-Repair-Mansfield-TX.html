This is normally utilized in a third-floor or second location and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
