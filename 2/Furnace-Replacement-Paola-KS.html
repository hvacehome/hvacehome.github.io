<p>Information supplied in this safety guide is based on existing scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The requirements do not require you to alter your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services should still be offered for your home's systems.

<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, considering that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
