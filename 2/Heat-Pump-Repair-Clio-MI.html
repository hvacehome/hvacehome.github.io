This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
