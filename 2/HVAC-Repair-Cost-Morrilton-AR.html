<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Morrilton AR</h3>
<p>Dunes Heating And A/c is HVAC Contractor supplying the best possible Heating and Cooling Repair, maintenance and installation for your house or service in Mount Pleasant, Charleston and Island of Palms South Carolina. You can rely on us to offer you with a system and option that fits your unique needs and because we have actually set up lots of systems in this area, we've earned a reputation for doing the job right the very first time.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
