<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather.

The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
