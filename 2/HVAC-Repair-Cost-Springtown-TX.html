This is usually utilized in a third-floor or 2nd area and benefits from the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
