<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Brandenburg KY 40108</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
