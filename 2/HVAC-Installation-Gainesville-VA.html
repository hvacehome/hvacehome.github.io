<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. Because it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
