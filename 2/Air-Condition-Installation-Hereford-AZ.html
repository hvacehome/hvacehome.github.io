<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

<p>Usually the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
