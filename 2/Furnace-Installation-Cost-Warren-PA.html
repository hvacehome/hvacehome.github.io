<p>Info supplied in this security guide is based upon present clinical and technical understanding of the issues presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. Buildings constantly develop as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them in addition to the residents, products, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a structure are constantly connecting, and this interaction leads to changes in each. For instance, we may see a window as changing somewhat in time as it becomes filthy, then is cleaned, collects dirt again, is cleaned again, and so on through its life. In truth, the dirt" we see may be evolving as an outcome of the interactions amongst the wetness, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your home, offering a comfortable climate in every room. However ducts that are not set up properly or maintained can disperse contaminants from one space to another. Gradually, dust, dander and even mold can build up in your ducts, decreasing the total air quality. Work with a professional to make sure your ducts are flowing fresh, tidy air.<p>

<p>Some health effects may appear shortly after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a pollutant. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are treatable and usually short-term. In some cases the treatment is merely removing the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Right after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma might appear, be aggravated or worsened.<p>
<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too little to be noticeable. After they are inhaled, they can remain and collect in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these illness do not show up till many years after exposure started. Most people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some industrialized illness from exposure to clothes and devices brought home from task sites.<p>
