<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
