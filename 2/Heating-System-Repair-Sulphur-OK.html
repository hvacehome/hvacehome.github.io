<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems at Sulphur OK</h3>
<p>Most people don't understand how humidity is eliminated from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the damp hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leak if your HVAC unit is not draining correctly. A restriction in your drainage pipes triggers a water leak. There are many different places a clog can occur. Among the main areas where clogs begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by certified HVAC specialists. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of individuals.<p>
