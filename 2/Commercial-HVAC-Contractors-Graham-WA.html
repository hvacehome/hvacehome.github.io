<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There must not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
