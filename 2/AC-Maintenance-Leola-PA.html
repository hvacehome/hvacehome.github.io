<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new houses are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house. A few of these styles consist of energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise called air-to-air heat exchangers). For more information about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Conservation and Renewable Resource Inquiry and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
