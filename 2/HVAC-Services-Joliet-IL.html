<p>A customized ac system that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the exact same air path. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room.

Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
