<p>Because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace.

Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated procedure.
