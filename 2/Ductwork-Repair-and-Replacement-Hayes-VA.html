However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
