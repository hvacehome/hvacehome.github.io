Refrigerant leaks can also be damaging to the environment.<p>

<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Heating is also one of the greatest energy consumers in your house, so house owners who might be purchasing a brand-new furnace ought to thinking about replacing it with a newer, more energy-efficient design to conserve cash and help the environment. The typical furnace lasts in between 15 and twenty years, so you're making a substantial investment in your home. Spend wisely by discovering as much as you can about available options.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
