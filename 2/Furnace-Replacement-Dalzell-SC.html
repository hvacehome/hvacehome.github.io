<p>Great Item! Shipment was kind of strange being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and requires time to use. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we solved concerns. I would recommend this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
