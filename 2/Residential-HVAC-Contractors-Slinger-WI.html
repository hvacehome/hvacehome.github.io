Not only was the rate terrific however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
