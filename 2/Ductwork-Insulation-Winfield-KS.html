<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who live in the home. Pollutants might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air toxin might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on moist or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care items. Germs and viruses, pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
