<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<h3>Getting Through Central Heating Installation in Plantsville CT</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
