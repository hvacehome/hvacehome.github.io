<p>Particular instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently tough to figure out if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is very important to take notice of the time and place the signs occur. If the signs fade or go away when an individual is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes.
