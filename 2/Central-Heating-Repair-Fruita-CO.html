<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
