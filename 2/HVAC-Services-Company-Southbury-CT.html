<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
