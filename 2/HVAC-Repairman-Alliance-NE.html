For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
