<p>The purpose of most structure ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building safety at sensible energy costs. Load calculating is described as the Handbook J calculation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for air conditioning. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based upon experience or on square footage alone, transfer to another contractor. Similar to measuring the size of an unit needed based upon BTUs, determining the correct size of unit for your house also depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
