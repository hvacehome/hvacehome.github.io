<p>These people have been great. At a real estate agent, I often require contractors to give me an opinion for what work on a home might cost. Recently I needed to call on these people twice. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably wouldn't wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the sincerity. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's an organisation model they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Speak with you quickly.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to run with the objective of selling or spinning off a firm at some point. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a large service in the field, and even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
