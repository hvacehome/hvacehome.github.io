<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
