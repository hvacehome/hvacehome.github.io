<p>These concepts-- and willingness to suffer through the heat-- may already be altering. Though just 33 percent of Seattle real estate units had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new housing systems have been integrated in the four years since or are currently under building and construction. The vast bulk of these units are multi-family or mixed-use, where air conditioning is more of a market standard, states Scott Vollmoeller of engineering firm Glumac.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating system is more trusted than alternatives, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar power depends on regular sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a dependable and readily available source of energy.<p>
