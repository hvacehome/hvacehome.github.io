<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Darien CT</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why this can happen. The good news is that you can resolve a number of these factors by yourself without the need to call for expert assistance. Start by opening the heat signs up and then carry on to checking the thermostat settings. Next, inspect the furnace power, reset the furnace or inspect the service door cover. You can likewise inspect the filter to ensure it is clear of dirt and inspect the standing pilot burner to make certain it is lit.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
