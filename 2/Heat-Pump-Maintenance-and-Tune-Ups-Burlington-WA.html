<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Burlington WA</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in house building and construction is to minimize air leak through cracks and other openings in roofings, walls, and floorings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
