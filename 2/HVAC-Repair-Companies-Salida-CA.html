Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
