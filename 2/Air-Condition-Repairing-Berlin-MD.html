<h3>AC Compressor in Berlin Maryland</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>When set up, underfloor heating needs practically no maintenance and includes a thirty years Warranty for overall peace of mind.
