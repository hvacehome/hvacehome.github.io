<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>

Bacteria or micro-organisms may likewise be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they may spread throughout the whole workplace or structure by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
