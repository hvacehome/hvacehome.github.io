<p>A 3rd way to choose whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your home.

Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
