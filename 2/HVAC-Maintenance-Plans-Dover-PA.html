<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, schools and offices matters, particularly given that we invest most of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the a/c unit is extra-large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your house.

If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>
