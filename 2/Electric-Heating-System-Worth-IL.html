<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
