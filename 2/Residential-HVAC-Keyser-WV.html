<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>We added a brand-new 1500 sf office space to perform our workshops and required some heating. After getting in touch with Integrity we were offered a terrific quote on a glowing flooring system.

It was an enjoyment dealing with such a professional company and would highly advise them to anybody searching for HVAC.<p>

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
