<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
