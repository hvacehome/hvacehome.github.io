<h3>Best Central Air Conditioner in Yorkville Illinois</h3>
<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is frosty, the evaporator coil is most likely frozen. Also, if the a/c unit smells bad, there might be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat far from your home. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to replace the air conditioning unit's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could flatter twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's since it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.
