<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that collects during summertimes. The best thing to do is ensuring that the heating unit burners are inspected and cleaned up thoroughly before chillier seasons begin.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated performance advantage. Because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Because an unit is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
