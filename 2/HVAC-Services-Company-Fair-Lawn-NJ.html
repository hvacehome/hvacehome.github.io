<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold might be residing in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Image 6).<p>

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
