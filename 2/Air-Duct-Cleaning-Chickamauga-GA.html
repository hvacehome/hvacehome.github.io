<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing.
