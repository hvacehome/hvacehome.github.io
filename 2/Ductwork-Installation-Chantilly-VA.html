<h3>Maximizing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System in Chantilly VA</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require fairly little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is necessary to keep the system functioning efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater resemble those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be checked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and gathered impurities (scaling in hard water locations). The systems need to be examined at least twice each year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector efficiency.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
