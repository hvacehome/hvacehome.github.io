<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
