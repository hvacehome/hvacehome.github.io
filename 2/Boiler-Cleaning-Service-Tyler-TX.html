<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Second of all like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
