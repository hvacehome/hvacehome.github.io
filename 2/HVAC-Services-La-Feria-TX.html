<p>The predominant health impact associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
