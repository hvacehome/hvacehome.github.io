<p>. Prior to picking the installation place of air conditioning unit, a number of main elements need to be thought about. First of all, the instructions of air circulation from the indoor units ought to not fall on the place of rest or work area. Second of all, there ought to not be any barriers en route of the air flow that might avoid it from covering the space of the properties as much as possible. The outdoor unit should also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from your house will not be efficiently discharged outdoors and the productivity of the whole system will drop dramatically.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
