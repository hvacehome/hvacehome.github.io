<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside. Many house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
