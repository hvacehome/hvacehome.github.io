<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>

Likewise, tidy ducts and proper airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have an expert technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
