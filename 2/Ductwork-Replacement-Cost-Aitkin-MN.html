<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
