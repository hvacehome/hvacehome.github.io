<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil modification in your vehicle. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter as soon as every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>

The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.
