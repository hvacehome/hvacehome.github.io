<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Service in Blacksburg</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>How To Get Rid of Boiler Problems in Blacksburg SC</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit.
