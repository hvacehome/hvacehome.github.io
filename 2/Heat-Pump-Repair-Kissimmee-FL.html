<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes throat, eye, and nose inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Typically the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more affordable technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
