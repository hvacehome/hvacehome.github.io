<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

The copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil.

Germs or micro-organisms might likewise be present within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the whole work environment or structure by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
