<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become air-borne, and thus, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline irritant might bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
