<h3>Heating And Cooling Repair in Greenville AL 36037</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

Bacteria and viruses, animal dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
