<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously.

The sound level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
