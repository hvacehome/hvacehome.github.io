<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
