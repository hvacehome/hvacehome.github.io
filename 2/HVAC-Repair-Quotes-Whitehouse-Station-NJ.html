Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

Improper modification, often suggested by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame idea is blue.

Never ever utilize a gas stove to heat your house. Constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>
