<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
