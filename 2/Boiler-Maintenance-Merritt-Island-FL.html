<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered.
