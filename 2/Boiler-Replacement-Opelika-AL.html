<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Opelika AL</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a constant temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling effect.
