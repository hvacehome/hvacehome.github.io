<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, oil or electrical energy to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual spaces. All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
