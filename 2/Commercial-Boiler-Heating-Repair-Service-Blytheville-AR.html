If your a/c is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Merely adding refrigerant is not a solution if it leaks. A skilled technician needs to repair any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the correct quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and performance of your air conditioner is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio.

The greater the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
