<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Individuals operating at Target aren't lazy or dumb and in this company all it takes is one small crack in your defenses and somebody will discover it and pry you wide open, in some cases in just a couple of days.
