They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to order it. My other half said that she had seen a great review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent individuals I have actually met in a very long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the genuine people who are there for us.
