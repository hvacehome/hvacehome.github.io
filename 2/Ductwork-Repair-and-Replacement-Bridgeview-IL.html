<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Because approximately 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated performance benefit. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions because they don't require any new ductwork to be set up.

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is improperly gotten rid of from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can also arise from lead dust from outside sources, including infected soil tracked inside, and usage of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>In more complex plans, warm air is permitted to flow and increase out high structure openings to the outdoors (stack effect ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use extremely little energy, however care must be required to guarantee convenience. In humid or warm environments, maintaining thermal convenience solely via natural ventilation might not be possible. Cooling systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outdoors air to condition spaces, however do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when suitable.<p>
