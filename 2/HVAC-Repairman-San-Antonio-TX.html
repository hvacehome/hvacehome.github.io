<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Try a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
