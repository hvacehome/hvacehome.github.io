After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
