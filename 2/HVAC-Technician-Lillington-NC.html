<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Lillington NC Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
