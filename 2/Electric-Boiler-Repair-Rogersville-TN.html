<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in hold-up features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes.

If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
