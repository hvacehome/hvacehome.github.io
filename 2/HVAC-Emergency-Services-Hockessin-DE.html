During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, a number of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
