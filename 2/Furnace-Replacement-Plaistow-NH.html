Many frequently they are mounted at height-level or somewhat lower, if individuals mainly stay seated in that particular area. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the flooring or ceiling; depending on what contaminant you're trying to track you'll need to put the sensing unit accordingly.
