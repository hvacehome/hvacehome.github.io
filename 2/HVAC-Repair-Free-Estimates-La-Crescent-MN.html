<h3>Electric Heating Systems in La Crescent MN 55947</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner".

When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
