<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
