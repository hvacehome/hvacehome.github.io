<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a simple and efficient  method to reduce ambient air pollution and possible health risks, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
