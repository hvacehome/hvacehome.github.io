<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

Professionals advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
