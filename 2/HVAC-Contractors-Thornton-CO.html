<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
