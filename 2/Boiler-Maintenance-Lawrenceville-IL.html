If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's most likely your issue. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The simplest method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
