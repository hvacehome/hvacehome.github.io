Simply as with switches, someone may have turned off a gas valve and then forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a handle that's perpendicular to the gas pipe, turn it so it's parallel.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Iâ $ m actually fussy with my things. I like my equipment and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with inexpensive knock-offs.

Itâ $ s simply perfect.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air contaminant resulting from gas that leaves into your house without being burned off. Older homes might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In cooking areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where wetness levels are typically greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
