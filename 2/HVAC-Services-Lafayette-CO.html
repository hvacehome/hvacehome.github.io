Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from.

I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
