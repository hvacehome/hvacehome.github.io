<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
