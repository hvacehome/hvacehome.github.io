<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
