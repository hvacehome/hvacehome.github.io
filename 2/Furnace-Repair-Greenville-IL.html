<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might choose to replace the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor system. Nevertheless, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and a/c styles, it may be smarter to change the entire system.<p>
