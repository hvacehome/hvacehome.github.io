<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
