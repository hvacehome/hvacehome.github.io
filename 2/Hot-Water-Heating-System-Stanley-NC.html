<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures consist of generating outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air outside.
