<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They include hold-ups in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Children, babies, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults since lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Kids might have higher exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

If it blows again, call a pro-- you've got more major problems.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
