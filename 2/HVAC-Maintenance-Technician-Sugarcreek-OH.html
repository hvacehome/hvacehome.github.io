<p>Check these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
