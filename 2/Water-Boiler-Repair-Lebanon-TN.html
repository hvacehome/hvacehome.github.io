<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
