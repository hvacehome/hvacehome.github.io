<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most inexpensive if your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>If you are thinking about setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house, plan on investing several thousand dollars for the complete system.

Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly cure and harden-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
