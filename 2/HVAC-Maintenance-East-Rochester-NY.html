<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can pay for, so many Seattleites should find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a vicious, harsh summertime.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
