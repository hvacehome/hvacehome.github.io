<h3>Commercial Boiler Heating Repair in Camilla GA 31730</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on price. It's tough to discover a sincere AC man and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
