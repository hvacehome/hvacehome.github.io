<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash can be found in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
