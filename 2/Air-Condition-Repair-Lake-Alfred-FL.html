<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Some health results might appear soon after a single direct exposure or duplicated direct exposures to a contaminant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are typically short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely removing the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, signs of some diseases such as asthma may appear, be aggravated or aggravated.<p>
