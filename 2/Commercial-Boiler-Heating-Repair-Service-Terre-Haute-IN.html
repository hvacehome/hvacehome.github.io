PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c unit into a heatpump While room air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
