<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 need to be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
