<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>The main factor homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services used. The cost might not be rewarding if the system is new and still under a producer's warranty. Any significant repairs must be covered under the producer's warranty. However, some producers need routine maintenance as a regard to the warranty.<p>
<p>As much of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one reaction stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the outcome of recurring use of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.  a very helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
