<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
