<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of outdoor or commercial settings.

(He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
