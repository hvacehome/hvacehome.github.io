<p>I typically do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
