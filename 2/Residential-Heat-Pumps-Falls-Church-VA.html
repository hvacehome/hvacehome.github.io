Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leakages, merely including refrigerant is not an option. A qualified technician should repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant.

<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Falls Church VA</h3>
<p>I was really happy in the beginning because things ran smoothly with no noise. Moreover, I saw visible changes in my electrical energy bills. After two years, things started to alter. There have been awkward sounds. I got it repaired and inspected. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. In general, it has been a great experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the beginning. However then realized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>
