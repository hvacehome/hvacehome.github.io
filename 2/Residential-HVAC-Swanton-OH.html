<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

If you're working with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software application. You get immediate, real-time access to the tracking results by means of a dashboard, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to figure out.<p>
