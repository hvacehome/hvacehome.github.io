<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
