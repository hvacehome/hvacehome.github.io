<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
