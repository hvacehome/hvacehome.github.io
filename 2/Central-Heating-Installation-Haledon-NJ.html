<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue when radon becomes caught in buildings and concentrations develop up indoors.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
