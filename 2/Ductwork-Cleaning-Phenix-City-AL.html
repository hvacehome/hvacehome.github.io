<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Phenix City AL?</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate.

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage.
