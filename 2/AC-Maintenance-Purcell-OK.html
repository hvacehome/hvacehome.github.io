<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Many AC systems feature a number of unique features that can further enhance efficiency and efficiency. For instance, house owners may want to try to find one that includes an integrated filter light that will notify you when the air filter requires to be changed. Another popular feature to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to reduce energy expenses even more. Naturally, more functions suggest higher central air conditioning expenses.<p>
