A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. Throughout high use months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
