Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the higher temperature levels sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions.
