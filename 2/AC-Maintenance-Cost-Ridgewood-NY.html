<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My eldest boy constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
