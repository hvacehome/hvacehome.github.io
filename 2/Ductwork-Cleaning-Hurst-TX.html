<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one ecological threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was understood how damaging lead could be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>A lot of well and city water does not normally contain lead. Water typically gets lead inside the house from home pipes that is made with lead materials.

Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.
