<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house via ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>

<p>A lot of HVAC companies will evaluate things like specialized filter modifications throughout Preventative Maintenance check outs, individually, as an include on service for you.
