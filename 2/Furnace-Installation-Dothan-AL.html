<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, because it is secured indoors. When it does require to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is unclean, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at optimal effectiveness and might overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, developing a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy costs to increase. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not big enough for your house. It will have to work harder and may overheat if the system is too small. Normally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
