<p>Another technique to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming indoors. Most house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors remove pollutants directly from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
