<p>Instantaneous discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are readily available to devices installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Service! Environment Pro is reliable and really cared about us and our scenario. We came home one night to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have actually the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might search for and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely glad to have a heated house again. What's most amazing was that this all taken place throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to assist us right prior to a holiday, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
