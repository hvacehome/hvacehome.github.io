<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>New air conditioners generally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score implies greater energy efficiency and potentially lower energy expenses.

It's not always about picking the model with the highest SEER score, it's finding the one that's right for you. This is where your dealership can assist.<p>

<h3>Benefits of Allergic Your Central Heating Boiler in Sugar Land TX</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math lately, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
