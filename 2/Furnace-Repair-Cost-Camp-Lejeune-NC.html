<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs unexpectedly appear higher than regular, it is most likely time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is even more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel bills right now, not to point out the money you'll save money on repair expenses. If your heater is 25 years old or more, you can probably expect to cut your fuel expenses in half.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All items in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood flooring joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and last flooring finish. This is usually used in a second or third-floor  location and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
