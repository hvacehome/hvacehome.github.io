<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as constructing products, furnishings, and household products like air fresheners, release toxins basically continuously. Other sources, related to activities carried out in the house, release toxins intermittently. These consist of smoking cigarettes, using unvented or malfunction-ing stoves, heating systems, or area heating systems, using solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, using paint strippers in remodeling activities, and the use of cleaning products and pesticides in house cleaning. High toxin concentrations can remain in the air for long periods after a few of these activities.<p>
