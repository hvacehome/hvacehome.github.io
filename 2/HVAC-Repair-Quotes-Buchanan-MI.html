<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Care Tips in Buchanan MI</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
