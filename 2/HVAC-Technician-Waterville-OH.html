<h3>HVAC Installation in Waterville Ohio</h3>

<p>Outdoor contaminants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Professionals recommend utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and normally are more appropriate for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>

However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
