<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair.

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the abilities or tools essential to examine refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however homeowners do not have the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician examine the system regularly.<p>
