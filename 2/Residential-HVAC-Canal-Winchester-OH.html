PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While room a/c provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
