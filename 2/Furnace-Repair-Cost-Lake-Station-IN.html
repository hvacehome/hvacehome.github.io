<p>In addition to getting the huge image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to offer threshold alerts. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might set up your tracking devices to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to resolve the scenario right away.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable influence on residents-- outdoors air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
