<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems at Morrison IL</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the a/c. I went on and purchased this Carrier and I must say it gets the job done rather well.

The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
