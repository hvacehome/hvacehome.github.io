Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, given that a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
