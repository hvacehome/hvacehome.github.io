<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, many Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. The copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil.
