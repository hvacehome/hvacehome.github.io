<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Tabor City NC</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>There's a huge distinction in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common kind of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, most of homes in cooler climates were warmed by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the walls, ceilings and floors warmed. In turn, the objects in the space, like furnishings and individuals, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>

<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including 3 (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but lots of utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better service.
