<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a big retailer who asked not to be named because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps track of energy usage and temperature levels in shops to save on costs (especially during the night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the stores fluctuate outside of an acceptable variety that might avoid consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
