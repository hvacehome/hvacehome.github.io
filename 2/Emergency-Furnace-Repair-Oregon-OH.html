<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Important Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate considerable cost savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up frequently, they can become obstructed with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can generally be carried out in just a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
