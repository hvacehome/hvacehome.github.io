<p>The world's leading all-in-one software for residential and commercial HVAC companies. HVAC service technicians go through a variety of possibly hazardous conditions. Technicians are frequently required to operate in confined areas, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofs of homes. They can be exposed to unfavorable weather condition for long periods of time. Given that they are called to structures without operating environment control, they are likewise subject to the severe hot or cold temperature levels existing inside a place.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump operate on electricity and work like a/c unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like an area heating system) with the very same amount of electricity.
