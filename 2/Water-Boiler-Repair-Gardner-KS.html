<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not use them.. Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
