<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and buildings build up indoors, direct exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>
