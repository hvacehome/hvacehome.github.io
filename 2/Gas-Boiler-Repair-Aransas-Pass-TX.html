You may also be tracking in lead from soil around your home. Soil very near houses might be polluted from lead paint on the outside of the building. Soil by highways and roads may be infected from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet before entering the house. Alter your clothes before you go home and clean these clothes independently if you work with lead in your job or a hobby.

<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to effectively cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
