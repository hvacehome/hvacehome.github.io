Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling impact.
