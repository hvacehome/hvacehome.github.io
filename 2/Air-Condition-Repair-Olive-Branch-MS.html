<p>My eldest son always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
