<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
