<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractors in Bessemer</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
