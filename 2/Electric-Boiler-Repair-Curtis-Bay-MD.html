<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Radiant heat offers a variety of special advantages over forced air heater. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy effective than forced air systems.

Sending heat through solid objects will also trigger it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home heated by a glowing system will heat up faster, and stay warm with less energy spent.
