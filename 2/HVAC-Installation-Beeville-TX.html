<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
