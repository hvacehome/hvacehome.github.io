<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
