<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
