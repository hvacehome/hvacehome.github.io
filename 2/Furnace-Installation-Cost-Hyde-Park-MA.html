<p>The probability of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends on several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends upon private sensitivity, which varies significantly from person to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and thus, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat allergen could bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
