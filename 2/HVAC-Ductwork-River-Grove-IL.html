<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer.

Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
