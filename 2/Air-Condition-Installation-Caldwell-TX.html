<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
