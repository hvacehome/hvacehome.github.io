<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperature levels reach freezing. Your heating technician can set up controls which automatically closed down the heatpump if temperature levels drop and reach below freezing. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While space a/c offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do.

Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have an expert technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
