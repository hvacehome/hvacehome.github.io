<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, given that some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
