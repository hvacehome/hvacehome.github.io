After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency.

In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
