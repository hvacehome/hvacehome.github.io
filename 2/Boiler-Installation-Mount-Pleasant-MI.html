<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
