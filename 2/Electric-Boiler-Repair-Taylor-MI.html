<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
