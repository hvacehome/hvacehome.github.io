Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, because it is secured inside. When it does require to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to install.
