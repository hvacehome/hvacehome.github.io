<p>In general, ductless AC units are more environment-friendly and energy-efficient than conventional A/cs. This is because you can shut off individual spaces when you're not occupying them. On top of that, ductless ACs can raise and lower their temperature level easily, saving you energy and cash that regular HVAC compressors will waste by continuously launching and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level.
