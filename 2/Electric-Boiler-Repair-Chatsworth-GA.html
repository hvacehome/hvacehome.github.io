<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
