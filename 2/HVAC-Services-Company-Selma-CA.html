<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% performance or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which might be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can mean substantial cost savings in yearly heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase performance even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
