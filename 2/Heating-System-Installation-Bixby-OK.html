The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 need to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
