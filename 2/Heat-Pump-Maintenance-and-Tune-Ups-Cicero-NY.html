<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
