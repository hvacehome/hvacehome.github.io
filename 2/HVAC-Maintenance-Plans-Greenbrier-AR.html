<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
