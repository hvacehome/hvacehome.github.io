<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
