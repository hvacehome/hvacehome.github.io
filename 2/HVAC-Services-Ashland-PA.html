We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic.

When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
