<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
