<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
