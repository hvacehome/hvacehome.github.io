<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Lastly, if you do determine an especially energy-efficient in-floor heater and choose to install it in your house, you might be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor costs. (And these expenses can be considerable. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, property owners can expect to pay between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heating system.) Speak With the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Resource (DSIRE) to see if there are refunds, loans or tax deductions readily available for the installation of a more efficient in-floor heater where you live.<p>
