It is also their responsibility to inform employees of the immediate dangers that are present.Specific state and local guidelines may use.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
