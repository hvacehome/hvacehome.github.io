<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
