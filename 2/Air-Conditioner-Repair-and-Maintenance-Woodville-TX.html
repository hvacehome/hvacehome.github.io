<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in gathering details on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.
