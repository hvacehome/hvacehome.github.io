<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic.

<p>The first a/c and fridges used flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in fatal mishaps when they leaked.

The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
