<p>I am a real estate investor, I need to change two furnaces in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as building products, home furnishings and items like air fresheners, can release contaminants more or less continually.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
