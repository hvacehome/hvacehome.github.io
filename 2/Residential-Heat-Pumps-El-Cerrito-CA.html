PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While room cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
