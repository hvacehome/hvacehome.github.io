<p>Circuit Board Replacement: Ã¢ $ " Ã The majority of furnaces have several control boards. The largest, or only one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonÃ¢ $ t work.
