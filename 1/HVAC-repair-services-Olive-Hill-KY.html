PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heat pump While space air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
