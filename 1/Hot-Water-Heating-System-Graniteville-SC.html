<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
