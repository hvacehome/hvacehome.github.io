<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Sean was really handy. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by qualified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
