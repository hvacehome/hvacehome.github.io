<h3>Home AC Repair in Pepperell Massachusetts</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
