<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Our group is led by the 2 Gamst brothers who both started dealing with air conditioning unit with their father John Gamst after school and on weekends. Whether it's maintenance, repair, furnace, or air conditioning installation, neither one keeps in mind finding out the trade it just came naturally. A structure like that and an enthusiasm to do the ideal thing is what makes our company what it is today. A Leading Technological HVAC believed leader and the only place to get a 5 year part guarantee with repairs.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
