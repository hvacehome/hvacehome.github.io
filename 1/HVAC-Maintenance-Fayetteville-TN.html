Since they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
