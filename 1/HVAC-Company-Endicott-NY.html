<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment producer's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is typically tough to measure, as one response stated the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not just break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of repeated usage of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, resulting in fractures and holes. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
