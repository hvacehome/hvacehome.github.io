<p>Just like the majority of house enhancement jobs, the cost of a complete central heater can differ extensively based upon the size of the home. Many heaters will last in between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, property owners should think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too quickly and shut down for too long, resulting in irregular temperature level levels.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
