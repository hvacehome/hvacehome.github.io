<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house.

<p>The rest of the HVAC system also needs to be in top condition for the air conditioning system to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the home.
