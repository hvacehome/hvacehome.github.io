<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in gathering information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
