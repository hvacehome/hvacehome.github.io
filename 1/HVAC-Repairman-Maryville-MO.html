Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is simple to install, particularly if you make it part of a construct or restoration project.
