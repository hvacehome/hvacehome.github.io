The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
