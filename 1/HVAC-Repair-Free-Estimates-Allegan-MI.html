Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the ac system will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also worsen indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system may be polluted (because of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for instance), and the system may spread these pollutants throughout the house.

Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all components of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is really heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
