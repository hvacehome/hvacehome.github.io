<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
