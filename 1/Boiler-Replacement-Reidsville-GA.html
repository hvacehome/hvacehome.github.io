<p>Your Review This is my third time utilizing Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is proficient with these devices).

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
