<h3>Locating Greatest HVAC Contractors in Bordentown NJ</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant.

Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
