<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
