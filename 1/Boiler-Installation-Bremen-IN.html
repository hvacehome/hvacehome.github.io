<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
