<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While space a/c supplies maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air.<p>

<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Wapato WA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
