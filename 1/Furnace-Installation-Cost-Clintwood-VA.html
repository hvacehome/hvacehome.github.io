<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Clintwood VA 24228</h3>
<p>While radon in water is not an issue in houses served by most public water products, it has actually been discovered in well water. If you've tested the air in your home and found a radon problem, and you have a well, get in touch with a laboratory accredited to determine radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon problems in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are lots of other contaminants that can not just unclean up the air, but result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and building materials contribute to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic compounds) from paint and even from some sort of carpets and upholstery materials can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
