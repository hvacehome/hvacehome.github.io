<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

However, a geothermal installation typically costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which usually implies it stops working in regards to roi.<p>
