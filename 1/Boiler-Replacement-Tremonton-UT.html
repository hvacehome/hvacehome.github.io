<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer.

This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Tremonton UT?</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as constructing materials, furnishings, and family products like air fresheners, release pollutants more or less continually. Other sources, associated to activities performed in the home, release contaminants periodically. These include smoking cigarettes, making use of malfunction-ing or unvented stoves, furnaces, or area heating units, using solvents in cleaning and pastime activities, using paint strippers in remodeling activities, and the use of cleaning products and pesticides in housekeeping. High pollutant concentrations can stay in the air for extended periods after some of these activities.<p>
