<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for homeowners to think about. Often times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally just available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying simply a cooling system.
