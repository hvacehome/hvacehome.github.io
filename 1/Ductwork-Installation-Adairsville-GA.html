<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, because it is secured inside your home.

In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
