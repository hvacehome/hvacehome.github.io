<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Davidsonville MD</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different house performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's services and products was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to carry out the essential electrical enhancements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
