To ensure the unit you pick is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load calculation price quote to identify the precise kind of heat and a/c system that's perfect for your home-we do not just change it with the same size system you presently have. These computations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is essential so the unit isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so.
