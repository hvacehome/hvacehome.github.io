<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
