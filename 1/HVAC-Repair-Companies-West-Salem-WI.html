<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, given that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
