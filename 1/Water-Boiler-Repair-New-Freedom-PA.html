<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.
