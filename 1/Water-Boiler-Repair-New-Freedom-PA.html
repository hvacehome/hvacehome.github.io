<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
