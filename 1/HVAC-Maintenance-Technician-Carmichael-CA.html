<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke causes throat, nose, and eye inflammation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort.
