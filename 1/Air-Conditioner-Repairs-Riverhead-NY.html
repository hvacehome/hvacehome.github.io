<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
