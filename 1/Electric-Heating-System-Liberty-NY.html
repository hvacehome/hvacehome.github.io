Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
