<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
