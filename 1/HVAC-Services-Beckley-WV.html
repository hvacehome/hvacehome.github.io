For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the skills or tools necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>

<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the rooms. The majority of modern hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
