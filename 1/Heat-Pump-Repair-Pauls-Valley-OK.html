<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
