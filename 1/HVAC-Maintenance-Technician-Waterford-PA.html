<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run since it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture.
