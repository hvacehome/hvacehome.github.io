<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
