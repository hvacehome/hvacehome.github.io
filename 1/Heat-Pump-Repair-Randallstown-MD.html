<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is honest, dependable, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to find a truthful AC guy and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely comprehensive in discussing what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn offered excellent client service at the end of the visit by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance tasks we might want to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques employed by some in the industry.<p>
