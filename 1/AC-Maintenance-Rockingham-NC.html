<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Rockingham NC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not offer them.  Secondly like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
