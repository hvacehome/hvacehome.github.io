Reedy chooses the owners stay on and reinvest a part of their equity from the sale back into the company, although this isn't a requirement.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

Exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and buildings develop up inside your home.<p>
