<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, electrical energy or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private spaces. All-electric boilers can attain up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
