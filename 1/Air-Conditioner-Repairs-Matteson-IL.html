<h3>Home Air Conditioning Service in Matteson IL 60443</h3>
<p>Many commercial structures use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that are part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some buildings can also make use of natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outside air introduced into a space per a system of time, and is often expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can discover the ASHRAE (American Society of Refrigerating, heating and air-conditioning Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for appropriate air quality online.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
