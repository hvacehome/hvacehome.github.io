<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have two significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
