<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Seaford DE?</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>All A-1 Mechanical's furnace repair technicians are equipped with fully-stocked trucks and advanced diagnostic tools needed to properly detect furnace problems and perform trustworthy repairs.

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't put the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it since it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow constraint will lower the unit's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
