<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<h3>What to Look for When Selecting an Jeffersonville IN HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
