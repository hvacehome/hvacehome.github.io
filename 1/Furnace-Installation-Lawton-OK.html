<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
