<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and extremely small particles of dust.

For example, he might seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation may be a more effective option to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
