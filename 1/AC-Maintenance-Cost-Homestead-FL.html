<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
