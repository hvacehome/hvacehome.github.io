Throughout the summertime and winter seasons, central air systems and furnaces provide enough cooling and heating power to houses in Redmond.

<p>Due to the fact that they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, below.<p>
