<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay items. Since they only partially eliminate the radon decay items and do not diminish the amount of radon entering the home, the effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain. EPA plans to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or could end up being, a trustworthy means of decreasing the health risk from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides further details on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
