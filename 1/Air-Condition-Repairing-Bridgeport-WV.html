Convected heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and connected them into a hot water supply.

By comparison, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can normally be performed in just a couple of minutes, typically with no tools required. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated hold-up features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do.

Likewise, tidy ducts and proper air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the needed equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have an expert technician check the system occasionally.<p>
