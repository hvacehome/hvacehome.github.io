<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
