<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance gos to per year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and usually some other benefits. Some companies provide top priority visits to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
