<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is usually greater than many heatpump alternatives, they can still be highly effective, depending on the model you acquire. Among the primary advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to greater temperature levels than other heating options. This suggests it can warm up your home to the preferred temperature level quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
