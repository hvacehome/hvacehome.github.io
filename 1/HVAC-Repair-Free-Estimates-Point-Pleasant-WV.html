<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The EPA recommends that you have your air ducts checked by a professional heating and cooling contractor. If your technician discovers that your air ducts have significant mold, dust, dirt, and other contaminants or a musty smell, they may advise duct cleaning This is specifically important if someone in your household has asthma, allergies, or other signs that might be connected to indoor air contamination.<p>

<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is wintry.

It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning system's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, nowadays. While lots of people presume contamination is just an outside problem, your home (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our houses are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we don't believe enough about direct exposure to all the important things we position in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- right away, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe easier.<p>
