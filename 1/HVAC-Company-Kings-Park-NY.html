<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can manage, many Seattleites should find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the reality of a vicious, harsh summertime.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
