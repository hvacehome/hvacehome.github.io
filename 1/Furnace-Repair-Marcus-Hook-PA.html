<p>Sean was very practical. He is an extremely enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater salaries for air conditioning tradespersons.
