<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
