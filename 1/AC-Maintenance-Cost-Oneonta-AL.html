<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an option for property owners to consider. Often times, these units contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are usually only offered for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system.
