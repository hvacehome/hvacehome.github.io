They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to order it. My spouse stated that she had seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have fulfilled in a long period of time.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
