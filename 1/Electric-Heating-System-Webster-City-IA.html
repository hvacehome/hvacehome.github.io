<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-term indoor air quality issue is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more intricate concerns-- identified by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 strategies listed below might be appropriate.<p>
