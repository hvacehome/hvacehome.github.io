<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the floor.

Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
