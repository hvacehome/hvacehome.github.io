<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use.

If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
