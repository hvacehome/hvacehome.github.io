<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a large retailer who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that consistently keeps track of energy intake and temperature levels in stores to minimize expenses (especially during the night) and to alert store supervisors if temperature levels in the shops fluctuate beyond an appropriate variety that might avoid clients from shopping at the shop.<p>

She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
