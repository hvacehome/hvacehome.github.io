<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are utilized to seeing this enter the yards of houses. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the house. However, there are some internal components too. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous rooms simultaneously, however are not very energy efficient.
