He understood just what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
