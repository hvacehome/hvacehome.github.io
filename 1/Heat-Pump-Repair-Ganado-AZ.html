<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and cure-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
