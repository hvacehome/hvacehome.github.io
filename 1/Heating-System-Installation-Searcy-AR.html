<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

Packaged units are fantastic for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, because the system is integrated.

For that reason, this may not be the best option for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
