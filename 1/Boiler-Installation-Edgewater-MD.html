<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
