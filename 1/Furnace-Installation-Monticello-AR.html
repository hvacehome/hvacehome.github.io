<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
