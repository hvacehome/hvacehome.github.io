Buildings constantly develop as a result of the modifications in the environment around them along with the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The different surfaces and the air inside a building are constantly connecting, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we may see a window as changing somewhat with time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned, builds up dirt again, is cleaned up again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see might be progressing as an outcome of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>

This does not sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal.
