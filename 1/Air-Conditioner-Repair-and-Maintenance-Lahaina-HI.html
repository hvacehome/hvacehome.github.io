The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (expressed as a portion performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>
