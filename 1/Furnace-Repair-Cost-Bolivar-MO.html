<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is always at a continuous temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling impact.
