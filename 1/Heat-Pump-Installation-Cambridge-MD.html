<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
