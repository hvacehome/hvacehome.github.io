<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
