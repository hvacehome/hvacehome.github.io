<p>I have been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is sincere, reputable, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website.

I myself was also in the service call service many years back and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
