<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, schools and offices matters, especially considering that we invest the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioning unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very damp climates or in cases where the a/c unit is oversized, it might not achieve a low humidity.

A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single go to, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year.
