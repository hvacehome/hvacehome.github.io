<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the unit has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
