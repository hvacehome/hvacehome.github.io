<h3>Heater Repair in Stratham New Hampshire</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
