<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
