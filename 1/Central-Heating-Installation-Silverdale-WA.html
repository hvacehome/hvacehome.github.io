<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same contaminants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, fetuses, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults considering that lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more conscious the damaging impacts of lead. Children might have greater exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
