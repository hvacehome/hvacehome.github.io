<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
