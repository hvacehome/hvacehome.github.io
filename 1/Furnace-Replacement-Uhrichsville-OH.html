<p>These people have been terrific. At a realtor, I often need contractors to provide me an opinion for what deal with a house might cost. Just recently I required to contact these men twice.

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
