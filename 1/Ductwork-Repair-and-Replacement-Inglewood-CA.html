<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great possibility; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on uncommon events.<p>
