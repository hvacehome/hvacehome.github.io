<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Throughout high use months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in flooring display screens.
