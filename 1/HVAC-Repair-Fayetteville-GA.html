<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
