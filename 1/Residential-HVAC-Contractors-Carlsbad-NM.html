<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
