<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was extremely happy they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them again.<p>
