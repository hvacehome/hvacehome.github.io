<p>We added a new 1500 sf workplace to conduct our workshops and needed some heating. After contacting Integrity we were given an excellent quote on a radiant flooring system. We were in a time crunch for upcoming occasion, and Tyler came right out and had us hooked up in a couple of days. The systems works fantastic and the new office feels very comfortable. It was an enjoyment dealing with such an expert company and would highly suggest them to anybody looking for HVAC.<p>
<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively cure and harden-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
