<p>The function of many building ventilation systems is to bring in adequate fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building security at reasonable energy expenses. Load determining is described as the Manual J computation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square video footage alone. As with determining the size of a system required based on BTUs, figuring out the correct size of unit for your house also depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>A SEER score stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the very same duration. Generally, SEER offers more data based on how the EER performs in different temperatures. The greater the system's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>
