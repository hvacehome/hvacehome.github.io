<p>We're investing a lot more time indoors, nowadays. While lots of people presume pollution is simply an outdoor issue, your home (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make certain that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we don't believe enough about direct exposure to all the important things we put in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big impact on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- immediately, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).

Before deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring just how much air gets away the system.<p>
