<p>Correct ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same toxins. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Apartments can have the same indoor air issues as single-family houses due to the fact that many of the contamination sources, such as the interior structure products, home furnishings, and household products, are comparable. Indoor air problems similar to those in workplaces are brought on by such sources as contaminated ventilation systems, improperly positioned outdoor air intakes, or maintenance activities.<p>

<h3>What to Look for When Selecting an Levittown PA HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
