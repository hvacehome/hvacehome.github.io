<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

Direct exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures construct up inside your home.<p>

Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, below.<p>
