These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
