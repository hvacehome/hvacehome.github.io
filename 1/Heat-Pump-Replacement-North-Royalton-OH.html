<p>If your air conditioner is more than eight years of ages, repair is probably not worth the expense, unless it's a basic problem like debris blocking the condenser system or a used fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to assess not just the condition of your existing equipment, but likewise the ducts that deliver the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your home.

<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized various methodologies. The CMHC study gotten in touch with numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they were part of a study, and the researchers did not control for time invested or methods used. The EPA research study prescribed and controlled techniques used on a smaller number of houses. While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have flaws, no other research study has challenged the findings. And although the devices and methods utilized by duct-cleaning companies have altered given that these studies were performed, the duct in homes haven't.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
