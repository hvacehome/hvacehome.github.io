<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature level. Furnaces that kick on often may be because of a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
