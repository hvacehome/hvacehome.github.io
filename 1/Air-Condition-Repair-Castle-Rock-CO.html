<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Ensure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
