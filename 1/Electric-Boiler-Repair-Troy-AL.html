<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
