<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company utilized 98% of the existing material acquired with your house. This company presented a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the evaluation on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace claiming health threat reason and contractor laws for their decision.

<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Parker CO 80134</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on among the most popular days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to assess situation & decided to opt for them for the work. I enjoy to say that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we spoke with from starting to end were really professional, considerate and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
