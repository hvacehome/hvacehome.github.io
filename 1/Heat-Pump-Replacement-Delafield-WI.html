<p>Examine these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
