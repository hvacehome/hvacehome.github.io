<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes dirty and old. The old coolant will negatively impact the system's performance. To make certain the system is working efficiently, think about having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
