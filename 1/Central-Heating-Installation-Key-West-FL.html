<h3>HVAC Repairman Near Me in Key West FL 33040</h3>
<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to assess scenario & decided to go with them for the work. I am happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we spoke to from beginning to end were extremely expert, polite and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heating unit can likewise be connected to a gadget known as a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat generated from the ground source heatpump compressor and utilizes it to heat water. This indicates that this gadget can likewise provide free hot water for domestic usage in addition to its standard geothermal heating and cooling function.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
