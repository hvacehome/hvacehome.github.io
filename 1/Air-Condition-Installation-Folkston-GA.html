<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
