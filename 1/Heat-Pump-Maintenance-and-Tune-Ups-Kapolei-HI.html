<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than outdoor or commercial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to individual spaces.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.
