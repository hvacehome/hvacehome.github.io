<p>Are you struggling to keep comfy throughout the Denver, CO summer season? When your air conditioning system fails to offer you with a welcome escape from the western heat, it's time to schedule AC repair services with a trusted HVAC technician experienced in all areas of service and repair. Fortunately, Denver and Littleton, CO location citizens can depend on Just Mechanical for all their AC repair requires for home a/c units and commercial cooling systems.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
