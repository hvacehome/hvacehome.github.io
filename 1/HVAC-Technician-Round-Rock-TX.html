<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.
