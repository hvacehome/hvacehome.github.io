When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
