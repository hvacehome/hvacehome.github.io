<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
