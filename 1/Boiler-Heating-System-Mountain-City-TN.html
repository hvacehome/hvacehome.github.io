<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
