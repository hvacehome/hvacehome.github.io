<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather.

The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>
