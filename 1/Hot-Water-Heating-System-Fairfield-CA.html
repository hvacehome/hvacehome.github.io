<h3>AC Replacement in Fairfield California</h3>
<p>As a skilled HVAC professional, we recommend you have your systems examined and regular maintenance carried out two times annually, when in the Spring (before cooling season) and when in the Fall (before heating season).

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

However, a geothermal installation usually costs tens of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which normally suggests it stops working in terms of roi.<p>
