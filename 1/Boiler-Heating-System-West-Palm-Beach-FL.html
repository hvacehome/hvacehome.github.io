<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in building are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural results. Atmospheric pressure differences produced by these forces move airborne toxins from locations of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the inside pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>We have been very pleased with Integrity's devices (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has worked very well and is so effective that it substantially minimized our energy costs - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years. The couple of times we require them for emergencies they responded quickly and fixed the issue.<p>
