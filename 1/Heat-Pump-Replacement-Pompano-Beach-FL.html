For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the tools or skills needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the essential devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still essential to have a professional technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
