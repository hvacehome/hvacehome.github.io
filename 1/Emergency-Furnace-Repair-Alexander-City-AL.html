<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German innovation". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to produce a business union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, r-410a and r-134a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in automobiles, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already commonly utilized in residential refrigeration.<p>

<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can often conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the possibilities are good that this may work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter once every three months. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
