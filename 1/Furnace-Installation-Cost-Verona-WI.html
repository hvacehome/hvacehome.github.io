<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heatpump operate on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heating system) with the same amount of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

This company presented a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the evaluation on an extremely cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health threat factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new home owner I have found out how to recognize the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
