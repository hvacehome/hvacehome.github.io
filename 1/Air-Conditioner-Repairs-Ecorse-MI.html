<p>My oldest kid always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny.
