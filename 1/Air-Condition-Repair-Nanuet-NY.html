<p>Seattle heaters can run nine months of the year. Based on the average temperatures in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a cars and truck it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life expectancy of 15 years.

Likewise, tidy ducts and proper airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>
