<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
