We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants. In other words, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
