<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated delay functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Often, indoor air quality issues in big commercial structures can not be successfully determined or corrected without a comprehensive structure investigation. These examinations may begin with written surveys and telephone consultations in which structure private investigators assess the history of resident symptoms and building operation treatments. Sometimes, these inquiries might rapidly uncover the problem and on-site visits are unneeded.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better solution.
