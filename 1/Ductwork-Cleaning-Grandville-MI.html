If you do take our recommendation, expect to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor costs to install central air. Furthermore, cooling contractors might charge an additional $50 to $200 for additional products and equipment.<p>
<p>First, understand that a majority of your central air and unit cost will come from the unit itself. AC system costs start at $2,000 and can actually exceed $10,000 for larger homes.
