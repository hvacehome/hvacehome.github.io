<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really valuable in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
