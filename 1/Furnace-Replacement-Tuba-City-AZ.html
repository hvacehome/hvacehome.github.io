<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the tools or skills essential to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the needed equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but lots of use the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a much better solution. If the existing system has actually not incurred other significant repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and concerns that caused the breakdown can be recognized and corrected, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, humans exhale carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not harmful, but may become dangerous if high concentrations are enabled to build up. Micro-organisms or germs may also exist within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the whole work environment or structure by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
