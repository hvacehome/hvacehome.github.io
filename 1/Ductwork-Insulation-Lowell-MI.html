<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
