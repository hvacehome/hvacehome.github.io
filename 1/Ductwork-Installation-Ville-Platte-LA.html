Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan need to spin.

Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it does not, you've offered it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
