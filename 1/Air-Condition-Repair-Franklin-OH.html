He knew just what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
