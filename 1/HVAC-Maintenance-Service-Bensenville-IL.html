<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Bensenville IL</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the service technicians thought they just didn't seem best and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
