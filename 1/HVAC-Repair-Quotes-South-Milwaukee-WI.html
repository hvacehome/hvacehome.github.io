<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
<h3>Heating System Repair in South Milwaukee Wisconsin</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
