<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Orange CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
