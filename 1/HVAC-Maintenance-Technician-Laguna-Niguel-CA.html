<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
