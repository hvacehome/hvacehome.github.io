<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
