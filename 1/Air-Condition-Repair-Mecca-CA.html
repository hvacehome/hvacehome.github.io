<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that best temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service plan which normally includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floors, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioner to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
