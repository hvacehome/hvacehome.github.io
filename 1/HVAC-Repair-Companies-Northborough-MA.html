<h3>How to Receive Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing in Northborough MA</h3>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
