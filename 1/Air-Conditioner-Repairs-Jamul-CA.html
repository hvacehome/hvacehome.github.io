Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the greater temperatures in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture indoors is associated with a higher prevalence of resident breathing issues.<p>

In damp or warm climates, maintaining thermal comfort solely by means of natural ventilation might not be possible. Cooling systems are used, either as backups or supplements.

Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, a lot of typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
