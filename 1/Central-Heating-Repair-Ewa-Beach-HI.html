Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter.

Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
