<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Exeter NH</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
