Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by many people.<p>

Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.
