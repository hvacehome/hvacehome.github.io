If the signs fade or go away when a person is far from the location, for instance, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some results may be made worse by an inadequate supply of outside air coming inside or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions prevalent inside your home.<p>
