HVAC professionals advise following this basic guideline when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>I have actually utilized around the clock for 5 plus years now. I have actually signed a yearly maintenance agreement which covers 2 services every year. Ilan has actually been great through all these years. Always keeps my system tuned and serviced. Have not had any issues. He informs me about it and proactively repairs the parts Whenever he sees any problems. Very happy with their service. Would suggest them anytime.<p>
