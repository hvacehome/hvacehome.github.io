<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Redding CT</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit.
