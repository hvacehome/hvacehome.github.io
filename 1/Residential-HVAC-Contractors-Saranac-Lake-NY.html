<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, given that a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each space.
