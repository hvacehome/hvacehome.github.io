<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
