Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
