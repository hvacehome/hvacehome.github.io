<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Service in Smithsburg</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system may be polluted (because of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for example), and the system might spread these pollutants throughout the home.
