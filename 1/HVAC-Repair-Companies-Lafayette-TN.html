<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were incredibly popular in the first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and very large houses. Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago stay operable, because the lack of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to use and tear. A steam boiler replacement expenses in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
