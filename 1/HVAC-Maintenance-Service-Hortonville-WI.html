<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically triggered by the absence of appropriate ventilation, which leads to a buildup of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the main problem in over half the workplace indoor air investigations it has carried out. Investigations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the very same to be real. These investigations exposed that proper ventilation is very important in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
