<h3>Home AC Repair in Placerville CA 95667</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are especially at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke causes throat, nose, and eye inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
