<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their total power needs to not surpass the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%.
