<h3>Air Condition Service in Vancleave Mississippi</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
