Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Before you head out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a few things to choose first. Where are you going to be installing the a/c unit? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the a/c unit be? Too big and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too little and your ac system will not have the ability to cool the house properly.
