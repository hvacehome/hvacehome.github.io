<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the go to. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part.
