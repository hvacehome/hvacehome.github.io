<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have multiple control boards. The largest, or just one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control board should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately identified, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
