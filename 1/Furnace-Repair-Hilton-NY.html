<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

From there you can take the appropriate action to solve the circumstance immediately.<p>
