<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Warm weather condition is a sign that spring is well in progress and that summer season, the most popular season of the year, will be here prior to you know it.
