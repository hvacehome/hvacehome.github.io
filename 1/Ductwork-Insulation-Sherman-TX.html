It does not depend on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>There are numerous variables that contribute to indoor air pollution. Such factors include making use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide gas given off by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls included in electrical transformers; radiation from constructing insulation; ozone from copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on occupants-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
