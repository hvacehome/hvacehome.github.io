<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly solidify and treat-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
