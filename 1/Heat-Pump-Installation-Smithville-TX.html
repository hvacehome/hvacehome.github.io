<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the appropriate temperature level. Heaters that kick on regularly may be due to a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.

You get immediate, real-time access to the tracking results via a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to decipher.<p>
