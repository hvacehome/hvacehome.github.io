<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, because some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
