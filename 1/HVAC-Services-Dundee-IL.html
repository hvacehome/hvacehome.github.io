<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, along with all other types of heatpump, have effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance, or POLICE. It's a clinical way of figuring out how much energy the system moves versus just how much it uses. Many geothermal heatpump systems have Polices of 3.0 to 5.0. This implies for every unit of energy utilized to power the system, 3 to five systems are supplied as heat.<p>

But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
