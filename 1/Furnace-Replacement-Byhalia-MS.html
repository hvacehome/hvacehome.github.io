<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources.

<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing material acquired with your house. This company presented a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing.
