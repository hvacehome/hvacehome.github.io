<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
