<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a big seller who asked not to be named because he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps an eye on energy usage and temperature levels in shops to minimize costs (especially in the evening) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the shops vary beyond an appropriate range that might avoid clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can pay for, a lot of Seattleites must discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a terrible, vicious summer season.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may pick to replace the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit. Consult a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor system if you do so. However, considering recent changes in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it might be better to change the whole system.<p>
