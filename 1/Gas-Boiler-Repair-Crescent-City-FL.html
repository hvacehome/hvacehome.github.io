<p>I have been using them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is sincere, reliable, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to find an honest AC guy and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
