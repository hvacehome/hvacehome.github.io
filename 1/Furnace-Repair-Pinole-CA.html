They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent.

He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
