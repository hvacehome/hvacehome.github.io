<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
