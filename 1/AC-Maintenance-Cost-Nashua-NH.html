<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly simple to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants given off by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity.

Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for homeowners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself however likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are usually only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capacity.
