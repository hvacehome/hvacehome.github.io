<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
