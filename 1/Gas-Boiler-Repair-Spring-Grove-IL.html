<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues.
