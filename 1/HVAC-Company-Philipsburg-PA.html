<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Prior to you begin installing the actual duct work, it is extremely important to plan your duct configuration in order to ensure that there suffices space in the floorings, ceilings, and walls to run your duct and that there suffices area in each room of your house to connect the heater.
