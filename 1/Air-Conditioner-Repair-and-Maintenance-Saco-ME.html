<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had identified the difficulty area in looking over the bill. He solved the issue in one day, had changed the costs to what I thought about reasonable prior to he called back, understood what might have triggered the issue and had a strategy to insure that it would not take place once again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have used them. This experience verifies that.<p>
<p>My oldest kid always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
