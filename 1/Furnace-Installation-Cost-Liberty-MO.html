<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
