<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your house that ideal temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service plan which generally consists of a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
