<p>Heaters resemble automobiles. As they age, you can replace one part only need another part changed or fixed next year. It doesn't take long to spend $500 just to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heaters incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

Furthermore, during winter season, the heat from underground can be absorbed to heat domestic water alongside its primary purpose of providing area heating. This suggests that cost savings are still realized during the colder period. In fact, a desuperheater reduces winter water heating expenses by around 50 percent.<p>
