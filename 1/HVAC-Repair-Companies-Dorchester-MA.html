<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works in Dorchester MA?</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and difficulty in breathing in some humans exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations may set off attacks in individuals with asthma. There is proof that some individuals can establish a level of sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has also been shown to trigger cancer in animals and might trigger cancer in humans.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
