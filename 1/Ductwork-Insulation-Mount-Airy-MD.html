<h3>Ductwork Insulation in Mount Airy MD 21771</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
