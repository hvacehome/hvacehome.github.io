<p>We got in touch with Elite A/C on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to evaluate circumstance & chose to choose them for the work. I enjoy to say that not only did we get the central air going however likewise replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke with from beginning to end were really professional, courteous and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete pieces, we recommend using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as a really efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of enabling heat to warm up the concrete slab listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Many AC systems come with a number of unique functions that can even more enhance performance and effectiveness. For example, house owners may wish to try to find one that comes with an integrated filter light that will alert you when the air filter requires to be altered. Another popular function to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on during the night to minimize energy costs even more. Of course, more features indicate greater central air conditioning expenses.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might choose to change the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit if you do so. However, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and cooling styles, it may be wiser to replace the whole system.<p>
