<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There ought to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
