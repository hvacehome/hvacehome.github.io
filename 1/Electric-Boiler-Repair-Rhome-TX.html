According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. Simply put, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>

Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
