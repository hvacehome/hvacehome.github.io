<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
