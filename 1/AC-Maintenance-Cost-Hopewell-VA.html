<h3>The Way to Choose An HVAC Company in Hopewell VA</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in home building is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in floorings, roofings, and walls. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Examine these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
