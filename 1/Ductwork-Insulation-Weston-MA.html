<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will constantly be the odd problem that sometimes shows up. It is extremely important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible when you do observe your furnace acting strangely. The faster you respond to issues with your furnace, the easier they are to fix. Waiting to call for repairs will only make the problem even worse, and frequently more costly.<p>
<p>A routine furnace tune up can make the most of performance and offer longer long lasting house heating. Nevertheless, there are times when a basic maintenance call can recognize a concern that will need a substantial financial investment to fix. Then, it's choice time. Do you make the costly repair and take pleasure in ongoing convenience from your present heating unit? Or, do you make an even bigger monetary dedication to changing the furnace? The decision to replace or repair depends on you, and typically it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into consideration the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely provides greater energy effectiveness and features service warranty coverage.<p>

Other possible sources of biological impurities are animals and family plants.<p>
