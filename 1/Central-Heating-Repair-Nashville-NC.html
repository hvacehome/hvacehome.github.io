<h3>Ductless Heat Pump in Nashville North Carolina</h3>
<p>The fact is, air pollution in your house can be just as bad - and even worse - than it is outdoors.

<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was sort of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we fixed problems. I would recommend this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
