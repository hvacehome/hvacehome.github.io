<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built.

Radon gas gets in homes through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains pipes, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes caught in buildings and concentrations develop up inside.<p>
