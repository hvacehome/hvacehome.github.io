<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
