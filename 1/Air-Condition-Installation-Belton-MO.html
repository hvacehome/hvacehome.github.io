<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that collects during summers. The best thing to do is making sure that the heating system burners are checked and cleaned thoroughly before colder seasons begin. Constantly make sure that the furnace is cleaned up annually to prevent soot and condensation which triggers burners to quit working properly. Possibly it is time to start thinking about buying a brand-new one if your furnace is in a very poor condition.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
