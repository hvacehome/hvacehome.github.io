<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can end up being blocked with particles that can restrict air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down completely. By comparison, examining and changing a furnace filter can generally be done in just a couple of minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
