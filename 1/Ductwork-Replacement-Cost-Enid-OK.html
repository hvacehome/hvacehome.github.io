<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
