<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the system. Loose, missing or faulty wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace includes examining the advised connections along with temperature and pressure gauges. Take some time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and safe.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
