Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the greater temperatures often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to offer thermal comfort inside your home.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
