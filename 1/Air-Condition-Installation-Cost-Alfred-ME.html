<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Alfred ME</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
