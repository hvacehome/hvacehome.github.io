<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Chesaning MI</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
