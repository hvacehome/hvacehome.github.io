<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
