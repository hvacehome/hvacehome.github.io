<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>How To Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Union Springs AL</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
