<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them until they have actually been effectively dried. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
