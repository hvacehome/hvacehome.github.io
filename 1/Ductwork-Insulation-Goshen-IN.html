<p>The most typical type of house heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or gas to produce heat. With a typical cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least costly choice, but newer systems can be extremely energy effective.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
