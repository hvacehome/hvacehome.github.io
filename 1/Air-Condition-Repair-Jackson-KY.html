<h3>Heating Service in Jackson KY 41339</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
