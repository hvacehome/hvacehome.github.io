<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged.
