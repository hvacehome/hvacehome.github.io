<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, the majority of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis.

The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
