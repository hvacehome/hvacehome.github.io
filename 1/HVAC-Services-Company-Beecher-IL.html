<p>Because an ac system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
