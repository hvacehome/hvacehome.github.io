<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones received. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex properly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post set up examination outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
