<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>

It is also crucial to keep in mind that air pollutants are universal and tend to have deep-rooted sources in the home's ventilation system.
