<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
