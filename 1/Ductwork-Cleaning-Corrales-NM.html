<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%.

Another repair indication is whether you had to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be truly cold on a below no night.<p>
<p>If you have a big home, a home with high ceilings, a house with numerous windows or a home with inadequate insulation, heating your floorings rather than the air might not be enough to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed.
