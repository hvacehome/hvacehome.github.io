The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by just using the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified representative from a service or seller to do the installation.

A voided service warranty won't do you any great ought to the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the beginning and employ a certified individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
