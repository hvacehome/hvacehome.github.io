<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house.

Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>
