If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's most likely your issue. The next step is to thaw your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter requires changing. The most convenient way to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
