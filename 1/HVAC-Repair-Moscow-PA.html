<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
