<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
