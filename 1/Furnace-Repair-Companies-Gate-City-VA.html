<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
