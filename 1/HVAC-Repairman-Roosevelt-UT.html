<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Secondly like prolonged automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the unit has been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
