<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if necessary, upgrade the structure envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation may be a more efficient option to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
