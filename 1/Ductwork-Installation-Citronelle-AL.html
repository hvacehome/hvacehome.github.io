<p>Unstable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from procedures or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>Over the previous couple of years, there has actually been some promotion suggesting that houseplants have been shown to decrease levels of some chemicals in lab experiments.

Since overly wet soil may promote the development of microbes which can impact allergic people, indoor houseplants must not be over-watered.<p>
