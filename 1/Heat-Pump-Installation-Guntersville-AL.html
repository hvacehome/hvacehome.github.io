<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the skills or tools required to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the needed devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a house heater, you might search for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or exceptionally hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
