<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be quickly integrated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or radiant flooring heating or can be set up in a brand-new building. Required air systems will require a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heating systems will need water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop needed depends upon the heating and cooling requirements for your home and is vital iin guaranteeing the efficiency and efficiency of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is measured in loads. Usually, a 3-ton setup must be sufficient for the average home, however house size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land schedule are all elements which will affect the right size for your particular home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can assist you appropriately size a system.<p>

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted 2 local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and valuable, Ballard Gas provided us a better offer, for exceptional service. Instead of an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating unit and situated methods we might have more even heat. He included these minor but considerable changes in his quote. Since of current warmer summers and for environmental reasons, we chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
