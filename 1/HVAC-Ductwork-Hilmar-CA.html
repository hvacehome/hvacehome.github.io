<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated performance advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Because they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your vehicle.

Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter once every 3 months. During high use months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>
