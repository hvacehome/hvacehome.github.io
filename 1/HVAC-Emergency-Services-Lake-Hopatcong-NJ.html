<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly treat and harden-- normally two to four weeks.
