<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having solved the problem with a simple repair he did on-site, not changing the whole part.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
