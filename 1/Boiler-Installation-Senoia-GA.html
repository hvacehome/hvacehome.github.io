<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Senoia GA</h3>

These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation.

For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many people.<p>
