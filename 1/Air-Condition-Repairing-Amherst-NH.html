<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Amherst NH</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
