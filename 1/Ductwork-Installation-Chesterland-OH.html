The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
