We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same contaminants. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Installed cost reflects the most common average set up cost throughout the USA for a 3 Ton system. Price might differ in your area. Cost varies will use to Standard Installation to include standard materials and service, which may vary by the kind of system or system component selected.

<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and place of toxin exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This enables products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Location control includes moving the pollutant source away from occupants or even relocating susceptible occupants.<p>
<p>Air flow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural results. Air pressure differences created by these forces move air-borne toxins from areas of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move up until the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
