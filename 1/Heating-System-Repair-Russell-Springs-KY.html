<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts years, given that it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
