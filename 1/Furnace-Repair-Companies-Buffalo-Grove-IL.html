<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating units are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>There are a great deal of benefits to using a radiant heat system over a traditional forced air heater.
