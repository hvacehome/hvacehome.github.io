<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your New Canaan CT Home</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
