<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the unit.

Take some time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are protected and tight.<p>

Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>All heating systems have some level of air purification. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne toxins flowing through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor.
