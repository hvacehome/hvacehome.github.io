You might look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and effectiveness if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to search for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
