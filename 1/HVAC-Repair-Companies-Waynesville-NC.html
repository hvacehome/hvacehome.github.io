Throughout high use months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>Make sure there are no rugs, furnishings, or anything else limiting the circulation of air. Not only will obstructed vents and registers affect your convenience, they can also lead to duct leaks due to excessive air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to supply sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
