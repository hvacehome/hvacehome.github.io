<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
