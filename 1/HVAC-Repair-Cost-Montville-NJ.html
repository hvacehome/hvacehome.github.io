<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
