<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of co2 in a lot of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Old heaters typically do not have the capability to hydrate and clean up the air in your home. Your house air might feel stuffy or stale.

Other signs might be regular dust accumulation, fixed shocks, drooping plants, furnishings splitting and musical instruments that do not stay in tune. These may appear like insignificant and somewhat silly observations but all recommend that your old furnace is not capable of offering you with the comfort you and your family may want and require.
