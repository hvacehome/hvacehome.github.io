<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
