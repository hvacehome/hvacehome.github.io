<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
