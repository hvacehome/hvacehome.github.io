<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

Central air systems and heatpump usually last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last approximately 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life expectancy, replacement might be the most cost-effective service.<p>
