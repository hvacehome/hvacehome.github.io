<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
