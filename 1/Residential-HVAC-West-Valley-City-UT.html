<h3>Getting Through Central Heating Installation in West Valley City UT</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
