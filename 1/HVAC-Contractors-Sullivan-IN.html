For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering early deterioration, leading to fractures and holes. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.  a really useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
