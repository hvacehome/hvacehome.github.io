<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
