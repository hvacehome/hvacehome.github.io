<p>We added a new 1500 sf office space to perform our workshops and required some heating. After getting in touch with Integrity we were given a fantastic quote on a glowing floor system. We were in a time crunch for upcoming occasion, and Tyler came right out and had us attached in a number of days. The systems works fantastic and the new office space feels very comfortable. It was a pleasure dealing with such an expert company and would extremely suggest them to anyone searching for HVAC.<p>
<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
