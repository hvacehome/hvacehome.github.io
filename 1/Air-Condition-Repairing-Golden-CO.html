<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, think about possible impacts of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, particularly instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating unit remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
