<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
