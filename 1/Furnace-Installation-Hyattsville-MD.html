<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
