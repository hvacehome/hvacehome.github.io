<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you must look out for. First, you ought to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
