<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

<h3>Ventilation Systems in Destrehan Louisiana</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>Some health impacts might appear shortly after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a pollutant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are treatable and typically short-term. In some cases the treatment is merely removing the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Right after exposure to some indoor air contaminants, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma may show up, be worsened or intensified.<p>
