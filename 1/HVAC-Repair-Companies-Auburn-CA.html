<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
