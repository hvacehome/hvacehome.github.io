<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. Connection concerns along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the unit.

Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making certain that they are tight and protected.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical functions of environmentally friendly homes as part of the growing green building motion.

By 2016, a Wall Street Journal short article predicted that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole real estate market.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
