<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
