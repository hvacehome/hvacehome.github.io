This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While space air conditioning supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
