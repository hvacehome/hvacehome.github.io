<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't offer off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.
