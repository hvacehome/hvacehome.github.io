<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

A basic a/c unit transfers heat energy out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside.

<p>I have been using Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are very knowledgeable and expert. Expenses are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. Due to the fact that the cost was undoubtedly reasonable, I did not bother to get rival's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff.<p>

<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. When the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and treat-- normally 2 to four weeks.
