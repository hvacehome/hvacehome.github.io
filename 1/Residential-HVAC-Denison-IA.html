We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the ac system prior to you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to check AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve money over the long term since of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as conventional air-source units. The lack of moving parts indicates you're less likely to invest huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're considerably more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
