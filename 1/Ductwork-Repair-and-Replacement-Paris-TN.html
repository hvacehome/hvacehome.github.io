<p>For instance, impurities may gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing contaminants into the environment. Or if the outside air intake is located near a source of moisture or other outdoor toxin, it may function as a path to carry the impurities inside.

I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is honest, dependable, and reasonable on price. It's tough to find a sincere AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
