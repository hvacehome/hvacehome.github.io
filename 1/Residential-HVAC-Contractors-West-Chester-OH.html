Due to the fact that the energy used to heat your house is extracted straight from the ground, it secures the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or pollutants.

While geothermal systems do utilize some electricity, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heater that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
