<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>In some cases a momentary indoor air quality problem is developed just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more intricate issues-- recognized by regularly unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the three tactics below might be appropriate.<p>
