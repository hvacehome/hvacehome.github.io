<h3>Powerful Tips for Furnace Cleaning at Watkinsville GA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater.

We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
