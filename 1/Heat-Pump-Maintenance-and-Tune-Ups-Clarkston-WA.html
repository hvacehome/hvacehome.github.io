<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
