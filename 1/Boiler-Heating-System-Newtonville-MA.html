<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square footage. They use a series of calculations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs needed to heat the area. The bigger the space, the more powerful the home heating unit needs to be.

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level.
