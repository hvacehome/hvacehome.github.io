<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and work environments matters, especially given that we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning unit assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in extremely damp climates or in cases where the a/c is oversized, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
