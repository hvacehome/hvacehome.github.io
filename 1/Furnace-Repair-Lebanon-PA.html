Because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
