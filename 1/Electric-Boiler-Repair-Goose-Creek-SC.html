Increase the length and width of each room in your house that you heat and add up all the spaces together to get your overall square footage.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
