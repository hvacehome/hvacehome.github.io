<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
