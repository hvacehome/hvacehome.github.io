<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer.

This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor carefully, many of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties remain in place. Moreover, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often hard to measure, as one reaction stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of recurring usage of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature deterioration, resulting in cracks and holes. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.. a really advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
