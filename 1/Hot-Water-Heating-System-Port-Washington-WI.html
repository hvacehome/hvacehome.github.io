Depending on the type of unit installed, it can be noisy and cause issues if you're extremely allergic to dust. Furthermore, particular fuels and devices may require unique licenses, and there is restricted versatility in case of changed heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the living space.<p>
