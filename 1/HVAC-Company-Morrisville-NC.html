Structures constantly evolve as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them as well as the residents, products, and activities within them.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might discover moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
