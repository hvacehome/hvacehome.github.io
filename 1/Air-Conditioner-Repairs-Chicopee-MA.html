<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
