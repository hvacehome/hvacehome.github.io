<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your a/c is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Simply including refrigerant is not an option if it leakages. A trained technician should repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and efficiency of your a/c is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be damaging to the environment.<p>

More recent gas boilers should attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>The remainder of the HVAC system also needs to be in top condition for the air conditioning unit to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the house.

Sealing leakages in ductwork can enhance HVAC effectiveness by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler home in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in automobiles in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by numerous individuals.<p>
