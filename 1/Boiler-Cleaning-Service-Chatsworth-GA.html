<h3>AC Technician in Chatsworth GA 30705</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs between $300 to $500 on average.
