<h3>How to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Saint Petersburg FL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
