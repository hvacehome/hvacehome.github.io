<h3>The Way to Keep Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Tecumseh MI</h3>
<p>One of the primary factors a furnace will run continuously is because something is dirty or blocked Before trying to repair any problem, take time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is great to go, examine the furnace blower for blocking and clean it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it. If you still can not find out why your furnace keeps running, call a skilled technician.<p>
<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
