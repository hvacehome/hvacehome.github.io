<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from products or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that frequently, our nationally representative survey discovered. Roughly 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
