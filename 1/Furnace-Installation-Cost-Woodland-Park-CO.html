<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
