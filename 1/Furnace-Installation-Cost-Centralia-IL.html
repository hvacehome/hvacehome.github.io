<p>I have actually been using them for years for my services, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he assisted me trouble shoot the issue. He is honest, trustworthy, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to find an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
