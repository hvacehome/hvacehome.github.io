<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Crossville AL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
