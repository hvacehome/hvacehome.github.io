<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
