<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
