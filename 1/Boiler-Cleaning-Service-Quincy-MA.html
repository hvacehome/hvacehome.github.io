<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is poorly eliminated from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can likewise result from lead dust from outside sources, including polluted soil tracked inside, and usage of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>

<p>Central air systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in gathering details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
