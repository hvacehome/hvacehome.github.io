<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
