<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
