<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
