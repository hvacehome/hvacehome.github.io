<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

Such factors include making use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide gas emitted by cigarette smoke and outdoors traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls contained in electrical transformers; radiation from developing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
