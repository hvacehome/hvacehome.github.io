When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down totally.<p>

<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Hesperia CA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
