Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>

<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did previously. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t actually think about anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is itÃ¢ and low $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's growth does not necessarily translate to the experience of operating an HVAC company. The air, heating and ventilation conditioning business tends to run cold and hot. Need warms up throughout the summertime and winter season when customers need their HVAC systems repaired for relief versus the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather gets here.<p>
