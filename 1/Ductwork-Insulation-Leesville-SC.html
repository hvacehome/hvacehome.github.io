<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
