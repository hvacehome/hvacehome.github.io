<p>If your air conditioner is more than eight years of ages, repair is probably not worth the cost, unless it's a simple problem like particles blocking the condenser unit or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to assess not simply the condition of your existing equipment, but also the ducts that provide the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those aspects may increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than setting up brand-new machinery.<p>
