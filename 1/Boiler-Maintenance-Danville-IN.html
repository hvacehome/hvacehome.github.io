Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
