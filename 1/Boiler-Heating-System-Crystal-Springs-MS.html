<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay items. Since they just partly get rid of the radon decay items and do not reduce the quantity of radon going into the house, the effectiveness of these gadgets is unsure. EPA prepares to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a dependable ways of minimizing the health danger from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further information on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly higher incomes for air conditioning tradesmen. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or just a high level of competitors for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's highest typical wages for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually.
