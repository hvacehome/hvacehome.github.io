Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new homes are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house. Some of these designs consist of energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also referred to as air-to-air heat exchangers).
