<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
