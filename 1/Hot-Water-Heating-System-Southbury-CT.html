<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product with time.

Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
