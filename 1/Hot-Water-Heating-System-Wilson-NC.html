<p>Central air units are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor.

With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
