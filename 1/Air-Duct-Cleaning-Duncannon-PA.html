Heat pumps run on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post set up assessment outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 heap R22 unit it changed (also Provider).<p>

Because they are really taxed in the summertime, since I live in FL it is critical to have a great AC system in your house.<p>
