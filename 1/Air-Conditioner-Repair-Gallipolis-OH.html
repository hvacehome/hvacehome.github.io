<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Gallipolis OH</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing Waychoff for about 10 years. First, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have actually kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are really experienced and professional. Expenses are affordable. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get competitor's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff since the cost was clearly reasonable.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
