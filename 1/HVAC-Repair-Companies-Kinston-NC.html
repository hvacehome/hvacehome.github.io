<p>Heating systems resemble automobiles. As they age, you can change one part only require another part replaced or fixed next year. It does not take long to spend $500 just to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Heaters incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair sign is whether you needed to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets harder to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be really cold on a below absolutely no night.<p>
<p>Terrific Item! Delivery was kind of unusual being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we solved problems. I would advise this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
