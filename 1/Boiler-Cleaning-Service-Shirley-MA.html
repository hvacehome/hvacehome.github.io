<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not offer agreements.  The so called trustworthy companies rip off more individuals than the fly by night clothing. I understand because I tried to work for them. Due to the fact that 90% of them are scoundrels, I stop. They stroll in with or without an agreement and start selling you things you don't require. They lie. How do I know. I now work as a consultant to confirm the so called solutions and problems. 9 out of 10, I inspect are totally wrong.<p>
<p>When setting up radiant heating, you need to give serious idea to the kind of floor covering in the house. Ceramic tile works well because it performs and stores heat. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less effective, but work reasonably well. Carpeting will directly insulate the floor from the space, reducing efficiency, so if you wish to set up carpet in a radiant-heated room, use a thin carpet with dense padding.<p>
<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

For me, I offer you the choices for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>
