<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
