<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to effectively cool the house on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
