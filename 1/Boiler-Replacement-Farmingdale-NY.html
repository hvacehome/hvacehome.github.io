<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants set off allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Infectious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxic substances. Signs of health problems caused by biological toxins include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and gastrointestinal problems.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
