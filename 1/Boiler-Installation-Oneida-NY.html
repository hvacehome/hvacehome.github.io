<p>A specific ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air course. A standard air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, given that all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is really warmed, just as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>

One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to withstand current, which then creates heat.<p>
