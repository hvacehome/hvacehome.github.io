Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution.

Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this.

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
