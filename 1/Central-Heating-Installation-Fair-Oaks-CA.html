<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

This is an excellent opportunity to recognize parts that are worn or defective. Changing them to repair the air conditioning might be a lot less costly when the issue is relatively minor.<p>
<p>I am really amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years earlier and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
