<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
