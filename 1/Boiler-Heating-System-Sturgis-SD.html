<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire.
