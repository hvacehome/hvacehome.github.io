I feel like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>

He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
