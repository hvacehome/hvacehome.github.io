<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
