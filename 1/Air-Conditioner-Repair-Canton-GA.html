<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Canton GA</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
