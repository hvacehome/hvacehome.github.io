<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper.

When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy.
