<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Company in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are ranked 90% effectiveness or better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which may be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can imply substantial savings in annual heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>

You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results through a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to figure out.<p>

<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>

You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC unit is not draining correctly. A restriction in your drain pipes triggers a water leakage. There are various locations an obstruction can occur. Among the primary areas where blockages begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
