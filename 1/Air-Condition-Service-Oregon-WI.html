<p>Heating systems as they age run the risk of establishing fractures in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide, if present, could leakage into your house undiscovered. Signs of this may be frequent headaches, a burning feeling in nose or eyes, queasiness, disorientation, flu-like signs. Ought to you experience any of these, air out your house, open a window to the furnace space and instantly call a service technician. Fractures in the heat exchanger can take place undiscovered which is why nobody recommends waiting until they occur. The furnace needs to be changed instantly if your family is potentially being exposed to carbon monoxide.<p>
<p>Picking the right size air conditioning system is a vital part of the HVAC buying process and one that you'll need an HVAC expert to assist you with. Here's why purchasing the right size a/c unit matters: if you purchase an HVAC system that's too huge, you'll end up losing cash and energy. And if it's too little, you will not get enough cool or warm air to keep you comfy.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
