On those days when you simply can't appear to heat up and find you require to show up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating. Because they heat surface areas and not the air itself, in-floor heating systems are not prone to this problem.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
