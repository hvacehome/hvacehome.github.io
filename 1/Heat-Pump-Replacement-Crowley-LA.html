<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>If you want to save yourself time and money over the long term, having actually annual maintenance performed on the furnace is a good concept.

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 significant components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>I was very pleased in the beginning due to the fact that things ran efficiently with no sound. Moreover, I saw obvious modifications in my electrical power bills. After 2 years, things started to change. There have actually been awkward noises. I got it examined and repaired. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. Overall, it has been a great experience. Reliable on the whole. Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the beginning. But then realized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
