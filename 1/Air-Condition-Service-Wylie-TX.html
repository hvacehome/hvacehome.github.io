<p>The most common kind of house heating system in the U.S. burns gas or gas to produce heat. With a typical cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least costly choice, however more recent systems can be really energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems usually achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely efficient gas furnaces can accomplish AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
