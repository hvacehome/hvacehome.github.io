<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
