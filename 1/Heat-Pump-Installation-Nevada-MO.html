<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is updated every 4 years. The Basics Handbook consists of heating and cooling computations. The design professional needs to speak with ASHRAE data for the requirements of design and care as the common building codes supply little to no details on HVAC style practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do consist of much detail on installation requirements, nevertheless.
