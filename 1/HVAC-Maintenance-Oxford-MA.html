<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract attempts to upsell you whenever they come to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for 7 years, although it was six months before the existing one expired. She didn't require a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
