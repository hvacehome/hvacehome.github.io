<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the see. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
