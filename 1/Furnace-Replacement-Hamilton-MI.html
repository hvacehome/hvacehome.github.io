<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is wintry.

It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to replace the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ issue. Your company needs to check measurements of temperature level, humidity and air flow. In addition, examination and screening of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to make sure it is working according to requirements for building usage and occupancy) should be performed. A building walk-through to check for odors and search for water damage, leaks, dirt or pest droppings may be valuable. Leakages need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become polluted with germs or fungis and require to be eliminated, likewise. In some scenarios, specific testing for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of structure tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Before you begin setting up the actual duct work, it is very crucial to plan out your duct configuration in order to make sure that there is enough room in the floorings, walls, and ceilings to run your duct and that there is enough space in each room of your house to link the heater.
