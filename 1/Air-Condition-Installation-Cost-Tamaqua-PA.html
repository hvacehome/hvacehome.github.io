<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really handy in gathering information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
