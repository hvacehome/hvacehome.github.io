<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home.

Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
