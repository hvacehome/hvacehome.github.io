<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Homes can have the same indoor air issues as single-family houses due to the fact that a number of the contamination sources, such as the interior building products, furnishings, and family items, are comparable. Indoor air problems comparable to those in offices are caused by such sources as infected ventilation systems, improperly positioned outdoor air intakes, or maintenance activities.<p>

<p>House owners may also assume that since a radiant flooring heating system can be seen (and funded) as a house improvement, its installation will instantly raise their house's value.

In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Value Report issued by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Renovation Magazine. Perhaps Realtors need to think about too many variables to definitively mention what a radiant heat system might add to, or deduct from, any offered asking price. That said, property buyers seeking to go green," who prioritize energy savings, or who definitely desire an in-floor heater will be willing to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
