<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space.

As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>
