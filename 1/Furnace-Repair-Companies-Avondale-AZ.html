<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
