<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature level of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
