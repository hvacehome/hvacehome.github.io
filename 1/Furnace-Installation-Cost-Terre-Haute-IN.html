The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also develop particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
