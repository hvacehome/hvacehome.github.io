<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Gloversville NY 12078</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
