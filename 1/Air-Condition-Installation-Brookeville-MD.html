<p>I have been using them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is sincere, trusted, and sensible on price. It's difficult to find an honest AC person and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
