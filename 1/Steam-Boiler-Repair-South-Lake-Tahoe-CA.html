<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Manufacturing integrates quality products and exceptional service with development and technological advances to deliver high-performance heating and cooling products worldwide. A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external unit.

<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>

Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed simply a few years ago.<p>
