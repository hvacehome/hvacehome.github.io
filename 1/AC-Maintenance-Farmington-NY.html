<h3>AC Unit Repair in Farmington New York</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have two major elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor starts however the fan does not, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan starts. , if it does not, you've provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
