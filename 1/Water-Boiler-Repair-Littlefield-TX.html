<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
