<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating unit, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no pollutant sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stagnant air" conditions.

When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of employees in the area, stagnant air might also be a problem.<p>

<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and final flooring finish. This is typically utilized in a third-floor or 2nd location and makes the most of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
