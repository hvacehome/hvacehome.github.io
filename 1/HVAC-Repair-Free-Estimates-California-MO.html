<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
