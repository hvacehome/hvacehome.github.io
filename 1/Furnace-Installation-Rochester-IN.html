<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service many years earlier and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
