<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems in Azle TX</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of replacing or exchanging air in any space to supply high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and excessive wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
