<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center.
