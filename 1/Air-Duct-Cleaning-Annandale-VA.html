Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
