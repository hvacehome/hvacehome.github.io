He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years ago and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.
