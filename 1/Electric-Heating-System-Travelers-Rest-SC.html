<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues in homes.

Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>The EPA recommends that you have your air ducts checked by a professional heating and cooling contractor.

<h3>HVAC Systems Are Essential for All Homes and Offices in Travelers Rest SC</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on numerous house performance upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's items and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to carry out the necessary electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
