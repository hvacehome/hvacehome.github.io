<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>A lot of reliable HVAC specialists will use free estimates with an in-person service call.
