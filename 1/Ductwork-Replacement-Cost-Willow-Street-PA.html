<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions.

Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>The early few years of your business are an exciting time, and it's tempting to let pure interest direct your course forward.
