<p>Make certain there are no rugs, furniture, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not only will blocked vents and registers affect your comfort, they can also cause duct leaks due to excessive air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years earlier and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
