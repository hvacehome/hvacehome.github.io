<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
