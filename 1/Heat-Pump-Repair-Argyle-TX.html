<p>Lots of commercial structures use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that belong to the heating and HVAC systems. Some buildings can also use natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outside air introduced into an area per an unit of time, and is typically revealed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can discover the ASHRAE (American Society of Air-Conditioning, refrigerating and heating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for appropriate air quality online.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the abilities or tools required to inspect refrigerant levels.

She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
