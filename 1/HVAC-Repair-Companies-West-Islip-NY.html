<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
