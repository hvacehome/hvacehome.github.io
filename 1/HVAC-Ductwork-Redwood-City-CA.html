<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
