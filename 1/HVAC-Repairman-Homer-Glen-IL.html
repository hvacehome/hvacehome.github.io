<h3>Air Condition Service in Homer Glen Illinois</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
