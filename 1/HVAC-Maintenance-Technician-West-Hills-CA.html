<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents. Unlike other types of ac system, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be permitted to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to preserve and comprehend.<p>
