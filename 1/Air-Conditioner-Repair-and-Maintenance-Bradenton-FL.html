<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
