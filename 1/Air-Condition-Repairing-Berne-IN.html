<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
