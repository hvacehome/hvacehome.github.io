<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. Connection concerns along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the system. Loose, faulty or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service.

<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heater, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
