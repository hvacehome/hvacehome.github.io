The quality of indoor air inside workplaces, schools, and other work environments is important not just for employees' convenience but likewise for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been tied to symptoms like headaches, fatigue, difficulty focusing, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some particular illness have actually been linked to specific air impurities or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger immediate signs but can lead to cancer after many years.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
