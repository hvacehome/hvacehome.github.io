<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases exposure to toxins throughout cooking. Improper modification, often shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you purchase a brand-new gas stove or range, think about buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns continually. Never ever use a gas stove to heat your home. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>
