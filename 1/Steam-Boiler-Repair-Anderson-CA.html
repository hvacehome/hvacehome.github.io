Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
