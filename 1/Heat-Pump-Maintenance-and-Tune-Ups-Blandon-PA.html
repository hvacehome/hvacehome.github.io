<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
