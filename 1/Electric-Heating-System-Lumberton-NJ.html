Manufacturers usually continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard enters into effect.<p>

Second of all, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of if it becomes wet.<p>
