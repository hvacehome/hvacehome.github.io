<p>If you set it too low, you're motivating the development of mold in wet air. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold development and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in gathering info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can pay for, so many Seattleites should discover ways to combat the heat without a duct system.
