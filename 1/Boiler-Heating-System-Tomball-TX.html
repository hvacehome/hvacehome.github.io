Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%.

Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
