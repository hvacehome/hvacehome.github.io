<p>Sean was really helpful. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
