The reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
