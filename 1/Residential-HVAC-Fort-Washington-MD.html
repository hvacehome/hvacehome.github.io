<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Fort Washington MD</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
