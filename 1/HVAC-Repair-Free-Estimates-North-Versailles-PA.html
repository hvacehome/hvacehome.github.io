<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
