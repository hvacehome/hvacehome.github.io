<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most cost effective if your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heater can likewise be connected to a device referred to as a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat produced from the ground source heatpump compressor and uses it to heat water. This indicates that this device can also supply totally free hot water for domestic use in addition to its conventional geothermal heating and cooling function.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been checked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside ought to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
