<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
