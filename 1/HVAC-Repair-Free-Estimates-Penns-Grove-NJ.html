<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
