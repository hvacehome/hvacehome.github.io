<p>If you need furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else might come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to order it. My partner stated that she had seen a great review for James, so I called.
