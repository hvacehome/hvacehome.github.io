<p>I have actually been using them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he assisted me problem shoot the issue. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on price. It's tough to find a truthful AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
