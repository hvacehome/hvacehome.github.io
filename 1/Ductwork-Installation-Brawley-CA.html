They weren't cheap but a fast web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was really delighted they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was sort of odd being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire.
