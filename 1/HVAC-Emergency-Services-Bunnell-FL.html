<p>As much of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties remain in location. Moreover, the tangible outcomes of a PM is frequently hard to quantify, as one reaction mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repeated usage of a part that is out of balance.
