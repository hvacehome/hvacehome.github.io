<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
