<p>To be truthful, few of the centers managers who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service came to us because of that. Most of the time they were at first interested in from another location keeping an eye on some other aspect of their structures, such as energy use, in an effort to cut expenses.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
