Although temperatures are typically in the convenience range, some expert treatments, such as open heart surgical treatment, require low temperature levels (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, reasonably heats (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both convenience and procedure applications, the goal might be to not just manage temperature, however also humidity, air quality, and air movement from area to space.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
