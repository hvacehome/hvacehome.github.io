<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand.

Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
