<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency.

In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
