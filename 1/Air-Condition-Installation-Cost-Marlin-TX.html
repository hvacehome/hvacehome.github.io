<p>You're motivating the development of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold growth and contamination. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
