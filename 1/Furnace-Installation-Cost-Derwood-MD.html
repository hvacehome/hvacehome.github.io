Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its positioning on your property and its maintenance, it might sustain some damage during the winter. Most of the time, this simply includes some accumulation of dirt and debris, which is pretty simple to eliminate. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the outside of the system and guarantee that there is no rust, damage from collected wetness, or extreme wear to the outside.

Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down totally. By comparison, changing a furnace and checking filter can usually be done in just a few minutes, often without any tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
