<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the technicians thought they just didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
