<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
