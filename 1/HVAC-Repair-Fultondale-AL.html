<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside workplaces, schools, and other work environments is very important not just for employees' comfort but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been tied to signs like headaches, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Also, some specific illness have been linked to specific air impurities or indoor environments, like asthma with damp indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause instant symptoms but can cause cancer after several years.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system makers generally make rugged, high quality products. Start by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the system cool down for about five minutes prior to resetting any breakers.
