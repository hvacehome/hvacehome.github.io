<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
