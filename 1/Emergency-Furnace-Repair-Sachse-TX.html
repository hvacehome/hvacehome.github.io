Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
