<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
