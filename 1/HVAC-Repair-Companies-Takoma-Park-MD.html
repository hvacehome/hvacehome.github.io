<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>There are a lot of benefits to using a radiant heat system over a standard forced air heater. Radiant heat systems tend to be much more energy efficient than other heaters, for one thing. Forced air heater tend to suffer from things like duct leakages, which rob them of as much as 30% of their output.

What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
