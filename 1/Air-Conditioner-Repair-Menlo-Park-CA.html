<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  unit rather of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat distribution over the entire surface area of a floor warms the lower half of the space, covering inhabitants in heat at a lower overall temperature-- in some cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heating system." In other words, in-floor heater offer a various mode and level of comfort.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
