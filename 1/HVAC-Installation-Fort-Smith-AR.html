<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

All objects in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature level after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, including individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>
