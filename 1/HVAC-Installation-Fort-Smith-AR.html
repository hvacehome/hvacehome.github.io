<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level.
