<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning an organisation was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end objective.
