<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, babies, and kids are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults given that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more conscious the damaging effects of lead. Children may have greater direct exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
