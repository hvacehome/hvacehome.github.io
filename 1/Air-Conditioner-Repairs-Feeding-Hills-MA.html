<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern a/c) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
