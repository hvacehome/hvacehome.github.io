<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While space air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more expensive than central air.<p>
