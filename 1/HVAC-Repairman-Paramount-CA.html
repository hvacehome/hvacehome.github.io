<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
