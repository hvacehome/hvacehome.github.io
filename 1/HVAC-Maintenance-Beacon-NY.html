<p>The primary health effect related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
