<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
