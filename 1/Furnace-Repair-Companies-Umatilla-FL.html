<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors.
