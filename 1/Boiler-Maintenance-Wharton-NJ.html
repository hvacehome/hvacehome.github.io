<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard task that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.

<p>I confess I have not done the math recently, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
