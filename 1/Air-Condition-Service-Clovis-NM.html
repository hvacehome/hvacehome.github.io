<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>As mentioned above, triggering your new under tile floor heating system prematurely, before the mortar has cured, can cause the grout to crack or to not adhere appropriately, and might void the warranty of your mortar item. In some testing, even the tile broken when the system was run before the substance had actually treated. And mortar makers may refuse warranty coverage if you do not follow their directions.<p>
