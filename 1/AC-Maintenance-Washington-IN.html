<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
