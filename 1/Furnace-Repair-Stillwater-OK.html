<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
