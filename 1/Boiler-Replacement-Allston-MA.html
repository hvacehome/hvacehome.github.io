<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, since the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically only readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best alternative for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
