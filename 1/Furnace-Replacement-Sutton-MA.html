<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it concerns central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
