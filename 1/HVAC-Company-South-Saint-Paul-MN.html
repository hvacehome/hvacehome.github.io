<p>Homeowners may also presume that because a radiant floor heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a house improvement, its installation will right away raise their home's value.

Perhaps Realtors should think about a lot of variables to definitively state what a radiant heat system may contribute to, or deduct from, any offered asking cost.
