Radiant heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply.

<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
