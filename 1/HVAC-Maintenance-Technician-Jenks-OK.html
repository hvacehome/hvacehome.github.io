<p>Ask about training and accreditations. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it!

<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can pay for, a lot of Seattleites should discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system.
