<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
