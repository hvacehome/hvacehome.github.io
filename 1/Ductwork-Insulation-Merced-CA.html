<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
