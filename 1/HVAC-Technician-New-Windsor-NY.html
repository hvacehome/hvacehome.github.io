<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
