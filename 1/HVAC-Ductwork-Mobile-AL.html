<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down completely. By contrast, examining and changing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
