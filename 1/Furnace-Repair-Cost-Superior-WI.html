One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are forced to withstand existing, which then creates heat.<p>
