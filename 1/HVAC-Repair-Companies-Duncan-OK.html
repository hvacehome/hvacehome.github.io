<p>A customized ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic a/c unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air path. A basic air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, considering that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is really warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
