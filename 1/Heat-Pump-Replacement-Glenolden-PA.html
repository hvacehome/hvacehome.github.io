AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so.

<p>Using air filters can trap some of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable resource area suggests that "Air Filtration need to have a Minimum Performance Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to decrease the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can act as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can minimize the effectiveness of the coils.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heaters are gas heaters While oil is typically used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice between the two types. Gas furnaces cost about the exact same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real benefit of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>

Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works however the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
