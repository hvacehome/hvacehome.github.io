<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is updated every four years. The Basics Handbook consists of heating and cooling computations. The style expert must consult ASHRAE information for the standards of style and care as the typical building regulations provide little to no information on HVAC design practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do consist of much detail on installation requirements, however. Other useful reference products consist of products from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
