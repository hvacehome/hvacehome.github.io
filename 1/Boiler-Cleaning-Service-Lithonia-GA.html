<p>There are many reasons that this can occur. Fortunately is that you can attend to a lot of these aspects on your own without the requirement to require professional aid. Start by opening the heat registers and after that move on to checking the thermostat settings. Next, examine the furnace power, reset the furnace or check the service door cover.

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
