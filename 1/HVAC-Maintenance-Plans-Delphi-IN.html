<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
