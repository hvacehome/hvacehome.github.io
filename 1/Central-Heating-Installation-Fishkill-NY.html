<h3>The Way to Soundproof a Central Heating System in Fishkill NY</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants released by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high indoors might trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
