An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate since it merely takes more electricity to run a larger system. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a possibility to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
