<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
