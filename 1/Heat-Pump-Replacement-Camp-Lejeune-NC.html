<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
