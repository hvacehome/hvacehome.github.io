<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead.

<p>Recently, Target informed reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial intrusion into its systems was traced back to network qualifications that were stolen from a 3rd party supplier. Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in question was a refrigeration, air and heating  conditioning subcontractor that has actually worked at a number of places at Target and other top retailers.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, however a homeowner does not have the tools or abilities essential to examine refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have an expert technician check the system regularly.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can afford, a lot of Seattleites need to find ways to fight the heat without a duct system.

Meanwhile, in big box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the reality of a terrible, terrible summer season.<p>
