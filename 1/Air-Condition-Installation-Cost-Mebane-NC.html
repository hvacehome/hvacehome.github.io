<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They consist of delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, fetuses, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults because lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more conscious the destructive effects of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures considering that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
