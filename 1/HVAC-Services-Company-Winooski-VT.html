<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more residents there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable influence on occupants-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
