EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides additional details on air-cleaning gadgets to reduce indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
