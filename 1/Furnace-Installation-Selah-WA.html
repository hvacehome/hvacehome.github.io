<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit.
