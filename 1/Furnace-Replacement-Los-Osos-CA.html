<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioning unit is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leakages, simply including refrigerant is not a solution. A trained technician needs to repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate quantity of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the efficiency and effectiveness of your air conditioning system is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>If you wish to conserve yourself money and time over the long term, having yearly maintenance carried out on the furnace is an excellent idea.

<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold growth and should be disposed of. Often there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in surprise or hardly ever accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the moisture issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the location utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
