HVAC professionals recommend following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your home still heats to the best temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel extremely hot. Just be worried if your house is not heating up. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you should employ an expert to repair the unit and inspect.<p>
