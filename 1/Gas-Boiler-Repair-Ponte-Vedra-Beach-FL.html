<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
