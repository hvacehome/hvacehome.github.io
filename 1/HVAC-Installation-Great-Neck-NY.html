<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Great Neck NY</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in house construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofs, floors, and walls. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
