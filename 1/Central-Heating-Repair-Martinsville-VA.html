<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews in Martinsville VA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
