<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
