<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
