<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one ecological threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled.
