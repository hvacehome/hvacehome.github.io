<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
