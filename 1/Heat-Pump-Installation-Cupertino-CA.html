<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Service in Cupertino</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Appropriate ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software application. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results by means of a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to figure out.<p>
