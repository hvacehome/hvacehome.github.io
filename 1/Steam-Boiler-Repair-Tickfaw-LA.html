In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
