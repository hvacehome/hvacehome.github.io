<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
