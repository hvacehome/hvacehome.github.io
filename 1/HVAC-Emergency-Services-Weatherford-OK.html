<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big seller who asked not to be called since he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a team that consistently keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperatures in stores to save money on costs (particularly during the night) and to alert store managers if temperatures in the stores vary beyond an acceptable range that could avoid consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

In the process, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new homes are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house.
