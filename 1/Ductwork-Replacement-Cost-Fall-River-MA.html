<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, a lot of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
